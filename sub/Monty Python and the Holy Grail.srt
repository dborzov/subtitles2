1
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,700
Whoa there!

2
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,300
Halt!

3
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,400
Who goes there?

4
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:47,000
It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon
from the castle of Camelot.

5
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,500
King of the Britons!
Defeater of the Saxons!

6
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,000
Sovereign of all England!

7
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,200
- Pull the other one.
- I am.

8
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,600
This is my trusty servant Patsy.

9
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,100
We have ridden the length
and breadth of the land...

10
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,600
in search of knights who will join me
in my court at Camelot.

11
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,300
I must speak with your lord and master.

12
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,200
- What, ridden on a horse?
- Yes.

13
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,700
You're using coconuts.

14
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,400
- What?
- You're banging together two coconuts.

15
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,700
So? We have ridden since the snows
of winter covered this land.

16
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,700
Through the kingdom of Mercia...

17
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,900
- Where'd you get the coconuts?
- We found them.

18
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,600
In Mercia?
The coconut's tropical.

19
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,000
- What do you mean?
- This is a temperate zone.

20
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,800
The swallow may
fly south with the sun...

21
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,400
or the house martin or the plover
may seek warmer climes in winter...

22
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,800
yet these are not strangers
to our land.

23
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,000
Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?

24
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,500
Not at all.
They could be carried.

25
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,600
What? A swallow carrying a coconut?

26
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,400
It could grip it by the husk.

27
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,200
It's not a question
of where he grips it.

28
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,900
It's a simple question of weight ratios.

29
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,200
A five-ounce bird could not carry
a one-pound coconut.

30
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,700
It doesn't matter.

31
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,400
Tell your master that Arthur
from the court of Camelot is here.

32
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,600
In order to maintain
air speed velocity...

33
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:16,600
a swallow needs to beat its wings
43 times every second.

34
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,000
Please!

35
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,900
- Am I right?
- I'm not interested.

36
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,600
It could be carried
by an African swallow.

37
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:28,400
An African swallow, maybe,
but not a European swallow.

38
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,800
- That's my point.
- I agree with that.

39
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,900
Will you ask your master if he wants
to join my court at Camelot?

40
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,800
But then, of course,
African swallows are nonmigratory.

41
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,700
So they couldn't bring
a coconut back anyway.

42
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,800
Wait a minute. Supposing two swallows
carried it together!

43
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,900
No, they'd have to have it on a line.

44
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,100
Simple. They just use
a strand of crepon.

45
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,700
- Held under the dorsal guiding feathers?
- Why not?

46
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,900
Bring out your dead!

47
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,200
Bring out your dead!

48
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,400
Ninepence.

49
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,200
- Here's one.
- Ninepence.

50
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,200
- I'm not dead!
- What?

51
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,800
- Nothing. Here's your ninepence.
- I'm not dead!

52
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,200
- Here. He says he's not dead.
- Yes, he is.

53
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,200
- I'm not.
- He isn't?

54
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,400
- He will be soon. He's ill.
- I'm getting better.

55
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,400
You'll be stone dead in a moment.

56
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,100
I can't take him like that.
It's against regulations.

57
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,400
- I don't want to go on the cart!
- Don't be such a baby.

58
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,800
- I can't take him.
- I feel fine.

59
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,900
- Do us a favor.
- I can't.

60
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,100
Can you hang around?
He won't be long.

61
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,100
I've got to get to Robinson's.
They've lost nine today.

62
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,200
- When is your next round?
- Thursday.

63
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,900
- I think I'll go for a walk.
- You're not fooling anyone.

64
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,400
- Isn't there something you can do?
- I feel happy!

65
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,400
- Thanks very much.
- Not at all. See you on Thursday.

66
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,600
- Who's that?
- I don't know. Must be a king.

67
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,400
- Why?
- He hasn't got shit all over him.

68
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,200
- Old woman!
- Man!

69
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,800
Man. Sorry.
What knight lives in that castle there?

70
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,300
- I'm 37.
- What?

71
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,900
I'm 37. I'm not old.

72
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,000
- I can't just call you "man."
- You could say "Dennis."

73
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
- I didn't know you were called Dennis.
- You didn't bother to find out.

74
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,000
I said "Sorry" about the old woman,
but from behind, you looked...

75
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,300
What I object to is that you
automatically treat me like an inferior.

76
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,200
- I am king.
- Oh, king. Very nice.

77
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,000
And how'd you get that?
By exploiting the workers.

78
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,600
By hanging on to
outdated imperialist dogma...

79
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:50,600
which perpetuates the economic
and social differences in our society.

80
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:55,800
- If there's ever going to be progress...
- There's lovely filth down here.

81
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,200
- How do you do?
- How do you do, good lady?

82
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,600
I'm Arthur, king of the Britons.
Whose castle is that?

83
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,800
- King of who?
- The Britons.

84
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:08,300
- Who are the Britons?
- We are all Britons, and I am your king.

85
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,200
I didn't know we had a king. I thought
we were an autonomous collective.

86
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,400
You're fooling yourself.
We're living in a dictatorship.

87
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,800
A self-perpetuating autocracy
in which the working classes...

88
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,200
There you go bringing class
into it again.

89
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,200
That's what it's all about.

90
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,700
Please, good people. I am in haste.
Who lives in that castle?

91
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,600
No one lives there.

92
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,000
- Then who is your lord?
- We don't have a lord.

93
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,300
What?

94
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,000
We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune.

95
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:40,300
We take turns to act as sort of
an executive officer for the week.

96
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,000
But all the decisions
of that officer have to be ratified...

97
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,400
at a special biweekly meeting...

98
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,900
by a simple majority
in the case of internal affairs.

99
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,700
- But by 2/3rd's majority...
- Be quiet!

100
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:55,300
- I order you to be quiet!
- Order? Who does he think he is?

101
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,600
- I am your king.
- I didn't vote for you.

102
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,400
- You don't vote for kings.
- How'd you become king, then?

103
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,400
The Lady of the Lake...

104
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,500
her arm clad in the purest
shimmering samite...

105
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,200
held aloft Excalibur
from the bosom of the water...

106
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,300
signifying by Divine Providence...

107
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,600
that I, Arthur,
was to carry Excalibur.

108
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,600
That is why I am your king.

109
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:22,000
Strange women lying in ponds,
distributing swords...

110
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,000
is no basis for government.

111
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:28,200
Supreme executive power derives
from a mandate from the masses...

112
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,700
not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.

113
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,900
Quiet!

114
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,600
You can't expect to wield
supreme executive power...

115
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,800
because some watery tart
threw a sword at you.

116
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,900
Shut up!

117
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,100
If I went around saying
I was an emperor...

118
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:45,500
just because some moistened bint lobbed
a scimitar at me, they'd put me away.

119
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,700
Shut up!
Will you shut up?

120
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,900
Now we see the violence
inherent in the system.

121
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,500
Shut up!

122
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,800
Come see the violence inherent in
the system. Help! I'm being repressed!

123
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,300
- Bloody peasant!
- What a giveaway! Did you hear that?

124
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,400
That's what I'm on about.
Did you see him repressing me?

125
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,200
You fight with the strength
of many men, Sir Knight.

126
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,900
I am Arthur, king of the Britons.

127
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,500
I seek the finest and bravest knights
in the land...

128
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,800
to join me at Camelot.

129
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,500
You have proved yourself worthy.
Will you join me?

130
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,300
You make me sad. So be it.
Come, Patsy.

131
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,600
- None shall pass.
- What?

132
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,600
None shall pass.

133
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,800
I have no quarrel with you,
but I must cross this bridge.

134
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,400
Then you shall die.

135
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:30,200
I command you, as king of the Britons,
to stand aside!

136
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:34,400
I move for no man.

137
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,000
So be it!

138
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:07,100
- Now stand aside, worthy adversary.
- 'Tis but a scratch.

139
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,800
- A scratch? Your arm's off.
- No, it isn't.

140
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:13,300
- What's that, then?
- I've had worse.

141
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,300
- You liar!
- Come on, you pansy!

142
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,400
Victory is mine.

143
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,100
We thank Thee, Lord,
that in Thy mercy...

144
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,300
- Come on.
- What?

145
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,300
Have at you!

146
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,800
You are indeed brave,
but the fight is mine.

147
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,300
Had enough, eh?

148
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,000
You stupid bastard,
you've got no arms left.

149
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,000
- Yes, I have.
- Look!

150
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,500
It's just a flesh wound.

151
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,100
- Stop that!
- Chicken!

152
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,200
I'll have your leg! Right!

153
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,900
- Right!
- I'll do you for that.

154
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,100
- You'll what?
- Come here.

155
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,500
- Are you going to bleed on me?
- I'm invincible!

156
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,900
You're loony.

157
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:07,000
The Black Knight always triumphs!

158
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,700
Have at you!
Come on, then.

159
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,500
All right, we'll call it a draw.

160
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,400
Come, Patsy.

161
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,000
I see. Running away, eh?

162
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:28,000
You yellow bastards! Come back here
and take what's coming to you!

163
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,000
I'll bite your legs off!

164
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,800
A witch! A witch!

165
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,700
A witch! We found a witch!

166
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,700
We've got a witch!
A witch! A witch!

167
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,400
We have found a witch.
May we burn her?

168
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,500
- How do you know she is a witch?
- She looks like one.

169
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,500
Bring her forward.

170
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,100
I'm not a witch!
I'm not a witch!

171
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,200
But you are dressed as one.

172
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,100
- They dressed me like this.
- No, we didn't.

173
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,500
And this isn't my nose.
It's a false one.

174
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,400
- Well?
- We did do the nose.

175
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,000
- The nose?
- And the hat. But she is a witch!

176
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,300
- Did you dress her up like this?
- No, no!

177
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,300
Yes. A bit.

178
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,800
She has got a wart.

179
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,900
What makes you think
she's a witch?

180
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,900
She turned me into a newt!

181
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,400
A newt?

182
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,100
I got better.

183
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,100
Burn her anyway!

184
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,400
Quiet! Quiet!

185
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,800
There are ways of telling
whether she is a witch.

186
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,200
- Are there? What are they? Tell us.
- Do they hurt?

187
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,100
Tell me, what do you do with witches?

188
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,600
Burn them!

189
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,900
And what do you burn,
apart from witches?

190
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,300
- More witches!
- Wood!

191
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,400
So why do witches burn?

192
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,000
- 'Cause they're made of wood?
- Good!

193
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,100
- How do we tell if she is made of wood?
- Build a bridge out of her.

194
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,900
But can you not also make bridges
out of stone?

195
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,300
Oh, yeah.

196
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,400
Does wood sink in water?

197
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,500
- No, it floats.
- Throw her into the pond!

198
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,900
What also floats in water?

199
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,200
- Bread.
- Apples.

200
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,400
- Very small rocks.
- Cider! Great gravy.

201
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,700
- Cherries. Mud.
- Churches.

202
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,700
- Lead.
- A duck!

203
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,400
Exactly.

204
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,900
So, logically...

205
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:02,800
If she weighs the same as a duck...

206
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,800
she's made of wood.

207
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,400
And therefore?

208
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,700
A witch!

209
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,900
- A duck! A duck!
- Here's a duck.

210
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,200
We shall use my largest scales.

211
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,300
Burn the witch!

212
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:44,100
Remove the supports!

213
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,400
A witch!

214
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,200
It's a fair cop.

215
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,300
Who are you, who are so wise
in the ways of science?

216
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,800
I am Arthur, king of the Britons.

217
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,000
My Liege!

218
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,700
Good Sir Knight, will you come with me
to Camelot...

219
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,500
and join us at the Round Table?

220
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,200
My Liege, I would be honored!

221
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,300
- What is your name?
- Bedevere, my Liege.

222
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,800
Then I dub you Sir Bedevere...

223
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,400
Knight of the Round Table.

224
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:30,200
<i>The wise Sir Bedevere was the first</i>
<i>to join King Arthur's knights.</i>

225
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,500
<i>But other illustrious names</i>
<i>were soon to follow.</i>

226
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,300
<i>"Sir Lancelot the Brave.</i>

227
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,100
<i>Sir Galahad the Pure.</i>

228
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,100
<i>And Sir Robin the</i>
<i>Not-Quite-So-Brave-As Sir Lancelot...</i>

229
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,400
<i>who had nearly fought</i>
<i>the Dragon of Angnor...</i>

230
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,500
<i>who nearly stood up to</i>
<i>the Chicken of Bristol...</i>

231
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,500
<i>and wet himself at</i>
<i>the Battle of Badon Hill.</i>

232
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:56,400
<i>And the aptly named,</i>
<i>Sir Not-Appearing-In-This-Film.</i>

233
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,700
<i>Together they formed a band</i>
<i>whose names and deeds...</i>

234
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,200
<i>were retold throughout the centuries. "

235
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,800
<i>The Knights of the Round Table.</i>

236
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,000
And that, my Liege, is how we know
the Earth to be banana-shaped.

237
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,700
And that, my Liege, is how we know
the Earth to be banana-shaped.

238
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,200
This new learning amazes me.

239
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:15,100
Explain again how sheeps' bladders
may be employed to prevent earthquakes.

240
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,300
- Certainly, sir.
- Look, my Liege!

241
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,300
- Camelot!
- Camelot!

242
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,200
It's only a model.

243
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,800
Knights, I bid you welcome
to your new home.

244
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,800
Let us ride to Camelot!

245
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,500
<i>We're Knights of the Round Table</i>
<i>We dance when e're we're able</i>

246
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,900
<i>We do routines and chorus scenes</i>
<i>with footwork impeccable</i>

247
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,200
<i>We dine well here in Camelot</i>
<i>We eat ham and jam and Spam a lot</i>

248
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,600
<i>We're Knights of the Round Table</i>
<i>Our shows are formidable</i>

249
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,100
<i>But many times we're given rhymes</i>
<i>that are quite unsingable</i>

250
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,400
<i>We're opera mad in Camelot</i>
<i>We sing from the diaphragm a lot</i>

251
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:18,700
<i>In war we're tough and able</i>

252
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,000
<i>In war we're tough and able</i>

253
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,400
<i>Quite indefatigable</i>

254
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,500
<i>Quite indefatigable</i>

255
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,600
<i>Between our quests we sequin vests</i>
<i>and impersonate Clark Gable</i>

256
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,200
<i>It's a busy life in Camelot</i>

257
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:34,300
<i>I have to push the pram a lot</i>

258
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,900
On second thought,
let's not go to Camelot.

259
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,200
- It is a silly place.
- Right.

260
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,900
<i>Arthur! Arthur!</i>

261
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,100
King of the Britons!

262
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,600
Don't grovel. If there's one thing
I can't stand, it's people groveling.

263
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,600
- Sorry.
- And don't apologize!

264
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,000
Every time I talk to someone, it's
"Sorry this" and "Forgive me that"...

265
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
and "I'm not worthy."

266
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
- What are you doing now?
- Averting my eyes.

267
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:18,700
Don't! It's like those miserable psalms.
They're so depressing.

268
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,200
- Now knock it off!
- Yes, Lord!

269
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,700
Arthur, king of the Britons...

270
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,200
your Knights of the Round Table
shall have a task...

271
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,100
to make them an example
in these dark times.

272
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,600
Good idea.

273
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,600
Of course it's a good idea!

274
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:37,400
Behold, Arthur,
this is the Holy Grail.

275
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,900
Look well, Arthur...

276
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,600
for it is your sacred task
to seek this Grail.

277
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,800
That is your purpose, Arthur.

278
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:49,000
The quest for the Holy Grail.

279
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,100
A blessing from the Lord!

280
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,800
God be praised!

281
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,900
Halt!

282
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,200
Hello!

283
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,300
Hello!

284
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,600
Hello? Who is it?

285
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,900
It is King Arthur, and these are
my Knights of the Round Table.

286
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,900
Whose castle is this?

287
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,500
This is the castle of my master,
Guy di Loimbard.

288
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,600
Go and tell your master...

289
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:35,500
that we have been charged by God
with a sacred quest.

290
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,800
If he will give us food and shelter
for the night...

291
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,000
he can join us in our quest
for the Holy Grail.

292
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,200
I'll ask him, but I don't think
he'll be very keen.

293
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,600
He's already got one, you see.

294
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:52,300
- What?
- He says they've already got one.

295
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,400
Are you sure he's got one?

296
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,600
Yes. It's very nice.

297
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,500
I told him we already got one.

298
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,000
Well, can we come up
and have a look?

299
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:07,000
Of course not!
You are English types.

300
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,600
What are you?

301
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:14,800
I'm French! Why do you think I have
this outrageous accent, you silly king?

302
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:18,100
- What are you doing in England?
- Mind your own business!

303
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:24,000
If you will not show us the Grail,
we shall take your castle by force.

304
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,600
You don't frighten us,
English pig-dogs!

305
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:31,900
Go and boil your bottoms,
sons of a silly person!

306
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I blow my nose at you,
so-called Arthur King!

307
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,500
You and all your silly English...

308
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,500
"kniggits."

309
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,600
- What a strange person.
- Look here, my good man...

310
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,800
I don't want to talk to you no more...

311
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:56,300
you empty-headed animal
food-trough wiper!

312
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,900
I fart in your general direction.

313
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Your mother was a hamster...

314
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:06,300
and your father smelt of elderberries!

315
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,800
Is there someone else we could talk to?

316
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:14,700
No. Now go away,
or I shall taunt you a second time.

317
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,500
This is your last chance.
I've been more than reasonable.

318
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,900
If you do not agree to my commands,
then I shall...

319
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,700
Jesus Christ!

320
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,100
Right!

321
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,100
Charge!

322
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,300
Run away!

323
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,900
Filthy fiends.
I'll tear them apart.

324
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,600
Sir, I have a plan.

325
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,600
- What?
- A present.

326
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,700
Hurry. Let's go.

327
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,100
What happens now?

328
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,400
Now Lancelot, Galahad and I...

329
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:25,000
wait until nightfall,
and then leap out of the rabbit...

330
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,500
taking the French by surprise.

331
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,200
Not only by surprise,
but totally unarmed.

332
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,400
Who leaps out?

333
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,500
Lancelot, Galahad and I...

334
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,000
leap out of the rabbit and...

335
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:48,200
Look, if we built
this large, wooden badger...

336
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,100
Run away!

337
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:07,000
- Feature for schools. Take eight.
- Action.

338
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:11,100
Defeat at the castle seems to
have utterly disheartened King Arthur.

339
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,000
The ferocity of the French taunting
took him completely by surprise.

340
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:20,500
And Arthur became convinced
that a new strategy was required...

341
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:24,900
if the quest for the Holy Grail were to
be brought to a successful conclusion.

342
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,200
Arthur, having consulted
his closest knights...

343
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:32,900
decided that they should separate
and search for the Grail individually.

344
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,700
Now this is what they did.

345
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,500
Frank!

346
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,200
<i>"The Tale of Sir Robin."</i>

347
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,800
<i>So each of the knights</i>
<i>went their separate ways.</i>

348
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:57,500
<i>Sir Robin rode north</i>
<i>through the dark forest of Ewing...</i>

349
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,000
<i>accompanied by his favorite minstrels.</i>

350
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:05,600
<i>Bravely, bold Sir Robin</i>
<i>rode forth from Camelot</i>

351
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:10,100
<i>He was not afraid to die</i>
<i>O brave Sir Robin</i>

352
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:14,300
<i>He was not at all afraid</i>
<i>to be killed in nasty ways</i>

353
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,000
<i>Brave, brave, brave Sir Robin</i>

354
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,300
<i>He was not in the least bit scared</i>
<i>to be mashed into a pulp</i>

355
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:27,800
<i>Or to have his eyes gouged out</i>
<i>and his elbows broken</i>

356
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:32,100
<i>To have his kneecaps split</i>
<i>and his body burned away</i>

357
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:35,700
<i>And his limbs all hacked and mangled</i>
<i>Brave Sir Robin</i>

358
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,800
<i>His head smashed in, his heart cut out</i>
<i>His liver removed, his bowels unplugged</i>

359
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:44,200
<i>His nostrils raped, his bottom burnt off</i>
<i>And his penis...</i>

360
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,300
That's enough music for now, lads.

361
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,800
Looks like there's dirty work afoot.

362
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,400
Anarcho-syndicalist
is a way of preserving freedom.

363
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,700
Oh, Dennis, forget about freedom!
And don't drop that mud.

364
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,900
Halt! Who art thou?

365
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:08,000
<i>He is brave Sir Robin</i>
<i>Brave Sir Robin who...</i>

366
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:11,200
Shut up!
Nobody really.

367
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,600
- I'm just passing through.
- What do you want?

368
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,700
<i>To fight and...</i>

369
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,500
Shut up!

370
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,100
Nothing really.

371
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,200
Just to pass through,
good Sir Knight.

372
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,700
I'm afraid not.

373
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,000
Actually I am
a Knight of the Round Table.

374
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:32,700
- You're a Knight of the Round Table?
- I am.

375
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,300
- In that case I shall have to kill you.
- Shall I?

376
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,600
- I don't think so.
- What do I think?

377
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,600
- Kill him.
- Let's be nice to him.

378
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,600
Shut up! And you!

379
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,900
Get the sword out.
I want to cut his head off!

380
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,200
- Cut your own head off.
- Do us all a favor.

381
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:50,600
- Yapping on all the time.
- You're lucky you're not next to him.

382
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:53,000
- What do you mean?
- You snore.

383
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,500
I don't. Anyway,
you've got bad breath.

384
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,900
- Because you don't brush my teeth.
- Stop bitching. Let's have tea.

385
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:04,400
All right. We'll kill him first,
then have tea and biscuits.

386
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,200
- Not biscuits.
- All right, not biscuits.

387
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,500
- Let's kill him anyway.
- Right.

388
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,800
- He's buggered off.
- So he has. He's scarpered!

389
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,300
<i>Brave Sir Robin ran away</i>

390
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,600
<i>Bravely ran away, away</i>

391
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,300
I didn't!

392
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:25,600
<i>When danger reared its ugly head</i>
<i>he bravely turned his tail and fled</i>

393
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,900
- <i>Brave Sir Robin turned about</i>
- I didn't!

394
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,900
<i>And gallantly he chickened out</i>
<i>Bravely taking to his feet</i>

395
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,400
- I never did!
- <i>He beat a very brave retreat</i>

396
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,900
- All lies!
- <i>Bravest of the brave, Sir Robin</i>

397
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,400
I never!

398
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,900
<i>"The Tale of Sir Galahad."</i>

399
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,300
Open the door!

400
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,900
In the name of King Arthur,
open the door!

401
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,900
Hello.

402
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,700
Welcome, gentle Sir Knight.

403
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,700
Welcome to the Castle Anthrax.

404
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,100
Castle Anthrax?

405
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:33,000
Yes. It's not a very good name,
is it?

406
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:37,900
But we are nice, and we will attend
to your every need.

407
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,600
You are the keepers
of the Holy Grail?

408
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,600
- The what?
- The Grail. It is here?

409
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:47,900
But you are tired,
and you must rest a while.

410
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,800
- Midget. Crapper.
- Yes, O Zoot?

411
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,600
Prepare a bed for our guest.

412
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:56,000
Thank you. Thank you.

413
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,500
Away, away, varletesses.

414
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:03,700
The beds here are warm and soft
and very, very big.

415
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:07,100
What is your name, handsome knight?

416
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:10,300
Sir Galahad the Chaste.

417
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:14,100
Mine is Zoot. Just Zoot.

418
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,400
- But come.
- No, please!

419
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,800
In God's name, show me the Grail.

420
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:22,400
You have suffered much.
You are delirious.

421
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,100
I have seen it. It is here.

422
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:30,000
You would not be so ungallant
as to refuse our hospitality.

423
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:34,500
I'm afraid our life must seem...

424
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:38,300
very dull and quiet
compared to yours.

425
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:41,200
We are but eightscore
young blondes and brunettes...

426
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,800
all between 16 and 19-and-a-half...

427
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:47,000
cut off in this castle
with no one to protect us.

428
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Oh, it is a lonely life.

429
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:53,700
Bathing, dressing, undressing...

430
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,700
making exciting underwear.

431
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,700
We are not used to handsome knights.

432
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,600
Nay, come, come.
You may lie here.

433
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:07,200
- Oh, but you are wounded!
- No, it's nothing.

434
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,700
You must see the doctors immediately.

435
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,200
No, please, lie down.

436
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,400
What seems to be the trouble?

437
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,000
They're doctors?

438
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,700
They have basic medical training, yes.

439
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:25,900
Come, come.
You must try to rest.

440
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,200
Dr. Piglet, Dr. Winston,
practice your art.

441
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:39,600
- Try to relax.
- Are you sure that's necessary?

442
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,600
We must examine you.

443
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:48,400
- There's nothing wrong with that.
- Please. We are doctors.

444
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,300
No! This cannot be.

445
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,700
- I am sworn to chastity.
- Back to your bed at once.

446
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,000
Torment me no longer.
I have seen the Grail.

447
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,900
- There's no grail here.
- I have seen it!

448
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,600
- I have seen...
- Hello.

449
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,200
No. I am Zoot's
identical twin sister Dingo.

450
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,400
- Excuse me.
- Where are you going?

451
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,900
I seek the Grail.
I have seen it here in this castle!

452
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,200
No! Oh, no!

453
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:47,200
- Bad, bad Zoot!
- What is it?

454
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,800
Wicked, bad, naughty Zoot!

455
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:54,400
She has been lighting our beacon, which
I've just remembered is grail-shaped.

456
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:58,700
- This is not the first time.
- It's not the real Grail?

457
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,500
Wicked, bad, naughty, evil Zoot!

458
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:07,000
She is a bad person
and must pay the penalty.

459
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,200
Do you think this scene
should have been cut?

460
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,200
We were so worried
when the boys were writing it.

461
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:15,800
But now we're glad. It's better than
some of the previous scenes, I think.

462
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:20,300
- At least ours was better visually.
- At least ours wasn't just pussy jokes.

463
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,100
- Get on with it.
- Yes! Get on with it!

464
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:28,700
- Get on with it!
- Oh, I am enjoying this scene!

465
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,200
Get on with it!

466
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,500
Wicked Zoot!

467
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,900
She must pay the penalty.

468
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,300
Here in Anthrax we have one punishment
for lighting the grail-shaped beacon.

469
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,600
You must tie her down on a bed
and spank her.

470
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,700
A spanking!

471
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,800
Spank her well, and after you have
spanked her, deal with her as you like.

472
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:58,400
- Then spank me.
- And me.

473
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,600
Yes. Give us all a good spanking.

474
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,800
And after the spanking,
the oral sex.

475
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,800
I could stay a bit longer.

476
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,000
- Sir Galahad!
- Hello.

477
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,400
Quick! Quick!
You're in great peril!

478
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:20,000
- No, he isn't!
- Silence, foul temptress!

479
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,400
- She's got the point.
- We will cover your escape.

480
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,900
I'm fine!

481
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:29,000
- I can tackle this lot single-handed.
- Let him tackle us singled-handed.

482
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,200
- No, Sir Galahad. Come.
- I can handle this lot easily.

483
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,600
Let him handle us easily.

484
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:40,000
Wait. I can defeat them.
There's only 150 of them.

485
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:44,000
Yes! He'll beat us easily!
We haven't a chance.

486
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,400
Oh, shit!

487
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,400
- You were in great peril.
- I don't think I was.

488
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:55,800
- You were in terrible peril.
- Let me go back in and face the peril.

489
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:59,600
- It's too perilous.
- My duty is to sample peril.

490
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:02,800
- We've got to find the Holy Grail.
- Let me have a bit of peril.

491
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,600
- No. It's unhealthy.
- I bet you're gay.

492
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,300
I am not.

493
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:11,800
<i>"Sir Lancelot had saved Sir Galahad</i>
<i>from almost certain temptation. "

494
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:14,500
<i>But they were no nearer the Grail.</i>

495
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,500
<i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>King Arthur and Sir Bedevere...</i>

496
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:19,700
<i>not more than a swallow's flight away</i>
<i>had discovered something.</i>

497
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,100
<i>That's an unladen swallow's flight,</i>
<i>obviously.</i>

498
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,600
<i>They were more than two laden</i>
<i>swallows'flights away.</i>

499
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:30,800
<i>Four if they had a coconut on a line</i>
<i>between them. If the birds walked...</i>

500
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,100
Get on with it!

501
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,900
<i>Anyway, on to scene 24,</i>
<i>a smashing scene with lovely acting...</i>

502
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:39,300
<i>in which Arthur discovers</i>
<i>a vital clue...</i>

503
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:42,600
<i>in which there are no swallows,</i>
<i>but I think you can hear...</i>

504
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:48,400
And this enchanter of whom you speak,
he has seen the Grail?

505
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,100
Where does he live?
Old man, where does he live?

506
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:00,200
He knows of a cave.

507
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:03,100
A cave which no man has entered.

508
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:05,600
And the Grail is there?

509
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:09,000
There is much danger,
for beyond the cave...

510
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:11,900
lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril...

511
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,100
which no man has ever crossed.

512
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,600
But the Grail!
Where is the Grail?

513
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:21,400
Seek you the Bridge of Death!

514
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:25,100
The Bridge of Death
which leads to the Grail?

515
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,200
Who are you?

516
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:17,200
- We are the Knights Who Say "Ni."
- No, not the Knights Who Say "Ni."

517
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,300
- The same.
- Who are thee?

518
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,900
We are the keepers of the sacred words:

519
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:26,600
"Ni," "Peng," and "Nee-wom"!

520
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,600
Those who hear them seldom live.

521
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:34,200
The Knights Who Say "Ni"
demand a sacrifice.

522
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:38,800
We are simple travelers who seek the
enchanter who lives beyond these woods.

523
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,600
We shall say "Ni" again to you...

524
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,600
if you do not appease us.

525
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:54,600
- What do you want?
- We want...

526
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,200
a shrubbery!

527
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:00,300
A what?

528
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:05,300
Please, no more!
We will find you a shrubbery.

529
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,900
You must return here with a shrubbery...

530
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,900
or else you will never pass
through this wood alive.

531
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:17,400
You are just and fair,
and we will return with the shrubbery.

532
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,600
- One that looks nice.
- Of course.

533
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:21,600
- And not too expensive.
- Yes.

534
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:24,900
Now go!

535
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,800
Stop that. Stop that.

536
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:13,900
Go on, clear off. Go away.

537
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,500
Do it. Go away.

538
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,600
And you, clear off!

539
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:24,600
Bloody weather.

540
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:28,300
<i>"The Tale of Sir Lancelot."</i>

541
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:36,900
One day, lad,
all this will be yours.

542
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,500
- The curtains?
- Not the curtains, lad.

543
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:44,100
All you can see stretched
over the hills and valleys of this land.

544
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:46,300
- This will be your kingdom.
- But, Mother...

545
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,800
I'm Father.

546
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:50,500
But, Father, I don't want any of that.

547
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:54,100
Listen, I built this kingdom
up from nothing.

548
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:57,100
When I started,
all there was was swamp.

549
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,100
All the kings said I was daft
to build a castle in a swamp...

550
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:03,600
but I built it all the same,
just to show 'em.

551
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:07,200
It sank into the swamp.
So I built a second one.

552
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:09,900
That sank into the swamp.
So I built a third one.

553
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,100
That burned down, fell over,
then sank into the swamp!

554
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:15,400
But the fourth one stayed up!

555
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,500
And that's what you're gonna get.

556
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:20,800
The strongest castle in these isles.

557
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:24,500
- I don't want any of that. I'd rather...
- Rather what?

558
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:28,900
I'd rather just sing!

559
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:32,900
Stop that! You're not going
into a song while I'm here.

560
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:36,100
Listen. In 20 minutes
you're getting married to a girl...

561
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:40,200
whose father owns the biggest tracts
of open land in Britain.

562
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,300
But I don't want land.

563
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,800
- Listen, Alice...
- Herbert.

564
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:48,500
We live in a bloody swamp.
We need all the land we can get!

565
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,700
But I don't like her.

566
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,900
Don't like her?
What's wrong with her?

567
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,700
She's beautiful. She's rich.

568
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,800
She's got huge...

569
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:01,200
tracts of land.

570
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:02,700
I know...

571
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:07,200
but I want the girl
that I marry to have...

572
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:11,600
a certain special something.

573
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:13,600
Cut that out!

574
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:17,400
Look, you're marrying
Princess Lucky...

575
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:20,600
so you better get used to the idea.

576
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:21,900
Guards!

577
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,900
Make sure the prince doesn't leave
this room until I come and get him.

578
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:28,900
Not to leave the room,
even if you come and get him.

579
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:31,300
No, no. Until I come and get him.

580
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:34,600
Until you come and get him,
we're not to enter the room.

581
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:39,800
No, no. You stay in the room
and make sure he doesn't leave.

582
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:42,200
- And you'll come and get him.
- Right.

583
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:46,300
We don't need to do anything apart
from just stop him entering the room.

584
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,700
- No, no. Leaving the room.
- Leaving the room. Yes.

585
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,700
All right?

586
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:56,200
- Yes? What is it?
- If... Oh.

587
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,200
It's quite simple.

588
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:03,400
You just stay here and make sure
he doesn't leave the room.

589
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,900
All right?

590
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,800
Oh, I remember.
Can he leave the room with us?

591
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:12,500
No, no. You just keep him in here,
and make sure...

592
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,500
Oh, yes! We'll keep him
in here, obviously.

593
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,800
But if he had to leave
and we were with him...

594
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:19,700
- Just keep him in here...
- Until you or anyone else...

595
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:22,200
- No, not anyone else, just me.
- Just you.

596
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:23,800
- Get back.
- Get back.

597
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:26,800
- Right?
- We'll stay here until you get back.

598
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,800
And make sure he doesn't leave.

599
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,500
What?

600
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,700
Make sure he doesn't leave.

601
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,000
- The prince?
- Yes, make sure he doesn't leave...

602
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:39,400
Oh, yes, of course.
I thought you meant him.

603
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:43,400
It seemed a bit daft, me having
to guard him when he's a guard.

604
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:46,400
- Is that clear?
- Oh, quite clear. No problems.

605
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:47,900
Right.

606
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,400
- Where are you going?
- We're coming with you.

607
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:57,000
No, no. I want you to stay here
and make sure he doesn't leave.

608
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:58,800
Oh, I see. Right.

609
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:03,800
Shut your noise, you!
And get that suit on!

610
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,700
And no singing!

611
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,000
Go get a glass of water.

612
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:06,200
- Well taken, Concord.
- Thank you, sir. Most kind.

613
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:08,000
And again.

614
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:11,800
Over we go! Good. Steady.

615
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:14,200
And now, the big one!

616
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,000
Come on, Concord.

617
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,300
Message for you, sir.

618
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,900
Concord, speak to me!

619
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,400
"To whoever finds this note:

620
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:39,900
I have been imprisoned by my father...

621
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:42,400
who wishes me to marry
against my will.

622
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:45,600
Please, please,
please come and rescue me.

623
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:49,300
I am in the tall tower
of Swamp Castle."

624
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:52,300
At last! A call!
A cry of distress!

625
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,800
This could be the sign that leads us
to the Holy Grail.

626
00:52:55,900 --> 00:53:00,200
Brave, brave Concord,
you shall not have died in vain.

627
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,200
I'm not quite dead, sir.

628
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,200
Well, you shall not have been
mortally wounded in vain.

629
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:10,200
I think I could pull through, sir.

630
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:11,700
Oh, I see.

631
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:15,200
- I think I'm all right to come with you.
- No, no, stay here.

632
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:19,100
I will send help when I have made
the daring and heroic rescue...

633
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,400
in my own particular...

634
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,300
- Idiom, sir?
- Idiom!

635
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:30,700
- No, I feel fine, actually, sir.
- Farewell, sweet Concord.

636
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,900
I'll just stay here, then,
shall I, sir?

637
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:37,400
Yeah.

638
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,000
- Morning.
- Morning.

639
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:57,600
You're not allowed
to enter this room...

640
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:02,400
O fair one, behold your humble servant,
Sir Lancelot of Camelot.

641
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,500
I have come to take...
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

642
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:08,200
- You got my note!
- Well, I got a note.

643
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:11,800
- You've come to rescue me.
- You see...

644
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:13,900
I knew someone would.

645
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:19,200
I knew that somewhere out there,
there must be someone who...

646
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:21,900
Stop that! Stop it!

647
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,700
- Who are you?
- I'm your son!

648
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:27,100
- Not you.
- I am Sir Lancelot, sir.

649
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:30,400
- He's come to rescue me, Father.
- Let's not jump to conclusions.

650
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:33,400
Did you kill all those guards?

651
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:35,400
Oh, yes. Sorry.

652
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:38,600
- They cost 50 pounds each!
- I'm sorry. I can explain.

653
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:42,600
Don't be afraid of him.
I've got a rope all ready.

654
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:45,200
You killed eight wedding guests in all!

655
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:48,700
- You see, I thought your son was a lady.
- I can understand that.

656
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:50,800
Hurry, Sir Lancelot.

657
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:55,100
- You only killed the bride's father.
- I didn't mean to.

658
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:59,300
- You put your sword through his head!
- Oh, dear. Is he all right?

659
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:02,200
You even kicked the bride.
This is gonna cost me a fortune.

660
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:06,300
I can explain. I was riding north
from Camelot when I got this note...

661
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:09,000
Camelot?
Are you from Camelot?

662
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:10,700
Hurry.

663
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:13,800
- I am a knight of King Arthur.
- Very nice castle, Camelot.

664
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,900
- Very good pig country.
- Is it?

665
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Hurry. I am ready.

666
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:22,600
- Would you like to come have a drink?
- That's awfully nice of you.

667
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:24,600
I am ready!

668
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:27,200
I mean, to be so understanding.

669
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:30,200
I'm afraid when I'm in this idiom,
I get carried away.

670
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:32,200
Don't worry about that.

671
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:40,900
This is the main hall. We're having this
made into one big living room.

672
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:44,200
- There he is!
- Oh, bloody hell.

673
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:47,900
Hold it!

674
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:56,200
- Please.
- Sorry, sorry.

675
00:57:56,200 --> 00:58:00,700
See what I mean? I get carried away.
I really must apologize. Sorry.

676
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:03,800
He's killed the best man!

677
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:06,400
Hold it. Hold it, please.

678
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,700
This is Sir Lancelot
from the court of Camelot.

679
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:14,000
A very brave and influential knight...

680
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:16,300
and my special guest here today.

681
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,400
- Hello.
- He killed my auntie!

682
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:21,000
Please, please!

683
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,100
This is supposed to be
a happy occasion.

684
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:28,700
Let's not bicker and argue
about who killed who.

685
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:33,400
We are here today to witness
the union of two young people...

686
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:36,000
in the joyful bond
of holy wedlock.

687
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:41,900
Unfortunately, one of them,
my son Herbert...

688
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,900
has just fallen to his death.

689
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:47,300
But I don't want to think
I've lost a son...

690
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:50,200
so much as gained a daughter.

691
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:56,000
- Since the tragic death of her father...
- He's not quite dead.

692
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,200
Since the near fatal wounding
of her father...

693
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:04,100
He's getting better.

694
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,300
For, since her own father...

695
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:12,000
who, when he seemed about to recover...

696
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:15,800
suddenly felt the icy hand
of death upon him...

697
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:18,700
Oh, he's died.

698
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:23,600
I want his only daughter
to look upon me as her own dad...

699
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:26,700
in a very real
and legally binding sense.

700
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:31,600
And I feel sure that the merger...
the union...

701
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:33,600
between the princess...

702
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:38,100
and the brave but dangerous
Sir Lancelot of Camelot...

703
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:40,200
Look! The dead prince!

704
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:47,200
- He's not quite dead.
- No, I feel much better.

705
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:49,900
You fell out of the tall tower,
you creep!

706
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:53,800
- No, I was saved at the last minute.
- How?

707
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:57,300
Well, I'll tell you.

708
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,400
Not like that! No!

709
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:01,100
Stop it!

710
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,800
<i>He's going to tell</i>
<i>He's going to tell</i>

711
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Quickly, this way.

712
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:14,200
No, it's not right for my idiom.
I must escape more...

713
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:16,900
Dramatically?

714
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,400
Dramatically.

715
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:20,700
Heave!

716
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:28,400
<i>What a wonderful escape</i>

717
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:34,300
Excuse me. Could somebody
give me a push, please?

718
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:51,300
Old crone.

719
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:56,500
Is there anywhere in this town
where we could buy a shrubbery?

720
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:00,300
- Who sent you?
- The Knights Who Say "Ni."

721
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:03,900
Ah, no. Never.
We've no shrubberies here.

722
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,800
If you do not tell us where
we can buy a shrubbery...

723
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:10,900
my friend and I will say...

724
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,200
We will say "Ni."

725
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,100
Do your worst.

726
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:19,900
Very well. If you will
not assist us voluntarily...

727
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:28,200
Never! No shrubbery!

728
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:32,400
- Nu!
- No, no. It's not that. It's "Ni."

729
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,200
- Nu.
- No. Ni. You're not doing it properly.

730
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:39,300
- Ni.
- That's it. You got it.

731
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:43,900
Are you saying "Ni"
to that old woman?

732
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:45,600
Um, yes.

733
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:48,600
Oh, what sad times are these
when passing ruffians...

734
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:51,600
can say "Ni" at will
to old ladies.

735
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:55,200
There is a pestilence upon this land.
Nothing is sacred.

736
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:57,300
Even those who arrange
and design shrubberies...

737
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:00,900
are under considerable economic stress
at this period in history.

738
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,900
- Did you say shrubberies?
- Yes.

739
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:06,800
Shrubberies are my trade.
I am a shrubber.

740
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:09,100
My name is Roger the Shrubber.

741
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,700
I arrange, design
and sell shrubberies.

742
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:19,600
O Knights of Ni, we have brought you
your shrubbery. May we go now?

743
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:23,300
It is a good shrubbery.
I like the laurel particularly.

744
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,600
But there is one small problem.

745
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,100
What?

746
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:30,800
We are now no longer
the Knights Who Say "Ni."

747
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:34,600
We are now the Knights Who Say
"Ecky, Ecky, Ecky, Pakang, Zoom-ping."

748
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,100
We must give you a test.

749
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:45,400
What is this test, O Knights of...
Knights Who Till Recently Said "Ni"?

750
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:49,700
Firstly, you must find
another shrubbery.

751
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:54,000
Not another shrubbery!

752
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:57,800
When you have found the shrubbery,
place it beside this shrubbery...

753
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:01,300
only higher to get the two-level effect
with a path down the middle.

754
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:02,600
A path!

755
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:07,100
Then when you have found
the shrubbery...

756
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:11,300
you must cut down the mightiest tree
in the forest...

757
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:14,700
with a herring!

758
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:18,700
- We shall do no such thing.
- Please.

759
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:22,600
Cut down a tree with a herring?
It can't be done.

760
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:25,400
- Oh! Don't say that word.
- What word?

761
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:30,600
I cannot tell. It is one of the words
the Knights of Ni cannot hear.

762
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:33,500
How can we not say the word
if you don't tell us what it is?

763
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:35,800
- You said it again!
- What? "Is"?

764
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:37,300
Not "is."

765
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,700
Wouldn't get far in life
not saying "is."

766
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:42,700
My Liege, it's Sir Robin!

767
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:45,900
<i>And packing it up</i>
<i>and sneaking away and buggering off</i>

768
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
<i>And chickening out</i>
<i>and pissing off home</i>

769
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:50,500
<i>Yes, bravely he is</i>
<i>throwing in the sponge</i>

770
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:54,200
- It's good to see you.
- Now he said the word.

771
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:56,800
Surely you've not given up your quest
for the Holy Grail.

772
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:59,700
<i>He is sneaking away</i>
<i>and buggering off</i>

773
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:02,200
- No, no. Far from it.
- He said the word again.

774
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:04,600
I was looking for it...

775
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:07,800
here in this forest.

776
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:09,900
It is far from this place.

777
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,200
- Stop saying the word!
- Oh, stop it!

778
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:16,400
- You said it again.
- That's it.

779
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:19,400
I said it! I said it!
Oh, I said it again!

780
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:22,100
That's three "its."

781
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:30,400
<i>And so Arthur and Bedevere</i>
<i>and Sir Robin...</i>

782
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:32,900
<i>set out on their search</i>
<i>to find the Enchanter...</i>

783
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:36,700
<i>of whom the old man had spoken</i>
<i>in scene 24.</i>

784
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:40,500
<i>Beyond the forest,</i>
<i>they met Lancelot and Galahad...</i>

785
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,600
<i>and there was much rejoicing.</i>

786
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:56,700
<i>In the frozen land of Nador...</i>

787
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:59,300
<i>they were forced to eat</i>
<i>Robin's minstrels...</i>

788
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:02,600
<i>and there was much rejoicing.</i>

789
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,100
<i>Ayear passed.</i>

790
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:12,500
- <i>Winter changed into spring.</i>
- Nice.

791
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:15,100
<i>Spring changed into summer.</i>

792
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,700
<i>Summer changed back into winter.</i>

793
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:21,500
<i>And winter gave spring and summer</i>
<i>a miss and went straight into autumn.</i>

794
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,400
<i>Until one day...</i>

795
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:48,900
Knights...

796
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:51,400
forward.

797
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:31,700
What manner of man are you that can
summon up fire without flint or tinder?

798
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:35,500
I am an enchanter.

799
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,900
By what name are you known?

800
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,500
There are some who call me...

801
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:45,000
Tim.

802
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:47,100
Greetings, Tim the Enchanter.

803
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,200
Greetings, King Arthur.

804
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:52,200
- You know my name?
- I do!

805
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,700
You seek the Holy Grail.

806
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:06,100
That is our quest. You know much
that is hidden, O Tim.

807
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:07,600
Quite.

808
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:18,600
Yes, we're looking
for the Holy Grail.

809
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:20,800
Our quest is to find
the Holy Grail.

810
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,800
Yes, it is. Yeah.

811
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:28,000
And so we're looking for it.

812
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:31,500
- Yes. We have been for some time.
- Ages.

813
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:38,200
So anything that
you could do to help...

814
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:41,500
would be...

815
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:44,700
very helpful.

816
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:46,500
Can you tell us...

817
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:53,700
Fine. I don't want to waste
any more of your time.

818
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:58,000
But I don't suppose you could tell us
where we might find a...

819
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:02,300
A what?

820
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:07,700
- A grail?
- Yes, I think so.

821
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:11,300
- Yes.
- Yes.

822
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:13,700
Yes!

823
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:16,200
- Oh, thank you.
- Splendid.

824
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:24,000
Look, you're a busy man and...

825
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,200
Yes, I can help you find
the Holy Grail.

826
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:31,200
To the north there lies a cave...

827
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:33,700
the cave of Caerbannog...

828
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:38,500
wherein carved in mystic runes
upon the very living rock...

829
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:42,200
the last words
of Olfin Bedwere of Rheged...

830
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:49,100
make plain the last resting place
of the most Holy Grail.

831
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:51,500
Where could we find this cave,
O Tim?

832
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:53,800
Follow!

833
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:58,500
But follow only
if ye be men of valor!

834
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:02,900
For the entrance to this cave
is guarded by a creature...

835
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,100
so foul, so cruel...

836
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:09,600
that no man yet
has fought with it and lived!

837
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:13,700
Bones of full 50 men...

838
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:16,400
lie strewn about its lair!

839
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:18,100
So, brave knights...

840
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:22,700
if you do doubt your courage
or your strength...

841
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:27,200
come no further,
for death awaits you all...

842
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:30,600
with nasty, big, pointy teeth.

843
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:34,800
What an eccentric performance.

844
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:51,400
- They're nervous, sire.
- We best leave them and go on foot.

845
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:53,300
Dismount!

846
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:11,200
Behold the cave of Caerbannog.

847
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:14,700
Right. Keep me covered.

848
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:17,600
- What with?
- Just keep me covered.

849
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:19,000
Too late!

850
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,400
What?

851
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:22,400
There he is!

852
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:26,100
- Where?
- There!

853
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:29,000
Behind the rabbit?

854
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
It is the rabbit.

855
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:34,800
You silly sod!

856
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:36,800
- What?
- You got us all worked up!

857
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:38,900
That's no ordinary rabbit.

858
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:44,000
That's the most foul, cruel
and bad-tempered rodent you ever saw.

859
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:47,800
You tit! I soiled my armor
I was so scared.

860
01:10:47,900 --> 01:10:52,300
That rabbit's got a vicious streak.
It's a killer.

861
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:55,200
- Get stuffed!
- He'll do you up a treat, mate.

862
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:57,300
You mangy Scots git!

863
01:10:57,400 --> 01:11:00,000
- I'm warning you.
- What's he do, nibble your bum?

864
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,100
He's got huge, sharp...

865
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:05,200
He can leap about...

866
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:08,800
- Look at the bones!
- Go on, Bors. Chop his head off.

867
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:13,400
Right. Silly little bleeder.
One rabbit stew coming right up.

868
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:15,800
Look!

869
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:20,800
Jesus Christ!

870
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:23,500
- I warned you.
- I've done it again.

871
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:28,100
I warned you, but did you listen to me?
Oh, no. You knew it all, didn't you?

872
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:30,900
Oh, it's just a harmless
little bunny, isn't it?

873
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,800
Well, it's always the same.
I always tell them...

874
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:35,700
Shut up!

875
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:38,000
Right. Charge!

876
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:57,400
Run away! Run away!

877
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:08,900
How many did we lose?

878
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,400
- Gawain.
- Ector.

879
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:12,600
- And Bors. That's five.
- Three, sir.

880
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:17,600
Three. We better not risk another
frontal assault. That rabbit's dynamite.

881
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:20,300
Would it help to confuse it
if we run away more?

882
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:22,600
Oh, shut up.
Go and change your armor.

883
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:26,700
Let us taunt it. It may become so cross
that it will make a mistake.

884
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,500
Like what?

885
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:30,700
Well...

886
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:35,400
Have we got bows?

887
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:39,700
- We have the Holy Hand Grenade.
- Yes. The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch.

888
01:12:39,700 --> 01:12:43,400
'Tis one of the sacred relics Brother
Maynard carries. Brother Maynard.

889
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:46,500
Bring up the Holy Hand Grenade.

890
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:21,400
- How does it... How does it work?
- I don't know, my Liege.

891
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:23,400
Consult the "Book of Armaments."

892
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:27,900
Armaments, chapter 2,
verses 9 to 21.

893
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:35,000
"And St. Attila raised
the hand grenade up on high saying...

894
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:38,200
'O Lord, bless this thy hand grenade...

895
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:41,600
that with it thou mayest blow
thine enemies to tiny bits...

896
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:43,600
in Thy mercy.'

897
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:45,600
And the Lord did grin...

898
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:49,900
and the people did feast upon
the lambs and sloths and carp...

899
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:54,700
and anchovies and orangutans
and breakfast cereals and fruit bats..."

900
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:57,400
Skip a bit, Brother.

901
01:13:57,400 --> 01:14:00,000
"And the Lord spake saying...

902
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:03,700
'First shalt thou take out
the holy pin...

903
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:06,300
then shalt thou count to three...

904
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:09,100
no more, no less.

905
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:11,700
Three shall be the number
thou shalt count...

906
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:14,500
and the number of the counting
shall be three.

907
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:19,500
Four shalt thou not count,
neither count thou two...

908
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:22,600
excepting that thou
then proceed to three.

909
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,700
Five is right out.

910
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:30,900
Once the number three,
being the third number, be reached...

911
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,300
then lobbest thou
thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch...

912
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:36,400
towards thy foe...

913
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:40,100
who, being naughty in My sight,
shall snuff it."'

914
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:43,500
- Amen.
- Amen.

915
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:45,300
Right.

916
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:47,600
One, two, five.

917
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:50,500
- Three, sir!
- Three!

918
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:37,900
There! Look!

919
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:40,200
- What does it say?
- What language is that?

920
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:43,900
- Brother Maynard, you're our scholar.
- It's Aramaic.

921
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:47,700
Of course.
Joseph of Arimathea.

922
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:49,800
- Of course.
- What does it say?

923
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:54,100
It reads, "Here may be found...

924
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:57,700
the last words
ofJoseph of Arimathea.

925
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:01,100
He who is valiant
and pure of spirit...

926
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:04,300
may find the Holy Grail...

927
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:08,900
in the castle of A-a-a-argh."

928
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:12,500
What?

929
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:15,900
"The castle of A-a-a-argh."

930
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:18,800
What is that?

931
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:21,000
He must have died while carving it.

932
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:23,900
- Oh, come on!
- Well, that's what it says.

933
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:28,900
If he was dying he wouldn't bother
to carve "A-a-a-argh." He'd just say it.

934
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:31,400
That's what's carved in the rock.

935
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:35,000
- Perhaps he was dictating.
- Shut up. Does it say anything else?

936
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:36,900
No. Just...

937
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:38,900
"A-a-a-argh."

938
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,600
Do you suppose he meant
the Camargue?

939
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:49,700
- Where's that?
- In France, I think.

940
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:52,900
Isn't there a St. A-a-a-argh's
in Cornwall?

941
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
- That's St. Ives.
- Oh, yes.

942
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:01,400
No, no. A-a-a-argh.
Back of the throat.

943
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:05,200
No, no. "O-o-oh" in surprise and alarm.

944
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:08,400
- You mean sort of a "aaah"!
- Yes, that's right.

945
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:10,700
Oh, my God!

946
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:16,900
It's the legendary
Black Beast of...

947
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:21,200
That's it! Run away!

948
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:32,900
Keep running!

949
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:39,200
We've lost him.

950
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:44,200
<i>As the horrendous Black Beast</i>
<i>lunged forward...</i>

951
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:47,000
<i>escape for Arthur and his knights</i>
<i>seemed hopeless...</i>

952
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:50,200
<i>when suddenly the animator</i>
<i>suffered a fatal heart attack.</i>

953
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:54,400
<i>The cartoon peril was no more.</i>

954
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:57,900
<i>The quest for the Holy Grail</i>
<i>could continue.</i>

955
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:13,200
There it is!
The Bridge of Death.

956
01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:14,700
Oh, great.

957
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:19,900
Look! There's the old man
from scene 24.

958
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,200
- What's he doing here?
- He's the keeper of the Bridge of Death.

959
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:25,900
He asks each traveler
five questions...

960
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:27,900
- Three questions.
- Three questions.

961
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,300
- He who answers the five questions...
- Three questions.

962
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:33,900
Three questions.
May cross in safety.

963
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,900
What if you get a question wrong?

964
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,400
Then you are cast
into the Gorge of Eternal Peril.

965
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:41,300
I won't go.

966
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:43,800
- Who's gonna answer the questions?
- Sir Robin.

967
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:46,600
- Yes?
- Brave Sir Robin, you go.

968
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:50,800
I've got a great idea.
Why doesn't Lancelot go?

969
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:53,600
Yes, let me go.
I will take it single-handed.

970
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:57,400
- I shall make a feint to the northeast...
- No. Hang on.

971
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:00,100
- Just answer the five questions...
- Three questions.

972
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:02,100
Three questions as best you can.

973
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:04,400
And we shall watch and pray.

974
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:06,200
I understand.

975
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:10,100
Good luck, brave Sir Lancelot.
God be with you.

976
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,000
Stop!

977
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:21,600
Who would cross the Bridge of Death
must answer me these questions three...

978
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:24,400
ere the other side he see.

979
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:27,200
Ask me the questions, bridge keeper.
I am not afraid.

980
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:29,600
What is your name?

981
01:19:29,700 --> 01:19:31,900
My name is Sir Lancelot of Camelot.

982
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:36,300
- What is your quest?
- To seek the Holy Grail.

983
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:40,200
- What is your favorite color?
- Blue.

984
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:41,900
Right. Off you go.

985
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:45,700
Oh, thank you very much.

986
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:51,000
That's easy!

987
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:54,400
Stop!

988
01:19:55,600 --> 01:20:00,400
Who approacheth the Bridge of Death
must answer me these questions three...

989
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:02,900
ere the other side he see.

990
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:06,500
Ask me the questions.
I am not afraid.

991
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:10,000
- What is your name?
- Sir Robin of Camelot.

992
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:13,700
- What is your quest?
- To seek the Holy Grail.

993
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:16,400
What is the capital of Assyria?

994
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:21,200
I don't know that!

995
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,800
Stop!

996
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:34,400
- What is your name?
- Sir Galahad of Camelot.

997
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:38,500
- What is your quest?
- I seek the Grail.

998
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:41,700
What is your favorite color?

999
01:20:41,700 --> 01:20:44,100
Blue. No, yel...

1000
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:54,900
Stop! What is your name?

1001
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:57,000
It is Arthur, king of the Britons.

1002
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:01,300
- What is your quest?
- To seek the Holy Grail.

1003
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:05,500
What is the airspeed velocity
of an unladen swallow?

1004
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:08,800
What do you mean,
an African or a European swallow?

1005
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:11,800
I don't know that.

1006
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:20,300
How do you know
so much about swallows?

1007
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:23,200
You have to know these things
when you're a king.

1008
01:22:02,900 --> 01:22:04,500
Lancelot?

1009
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:30,700
<i>Arthur</i>

1010
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:13,100
The Castle A-a-a-argh.

1011
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:15,700
Our quest is at an end.

1012
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:36,300
God be praised!

1013
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:41,700
Almighty God, we thank Thee...

1014
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:45,800
that Thou has vouchsafed to us
the most Holy...

1015
01:24:45,900 --> 01:24:47,800
Jesus Christ!

1016
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:53,100
Hello, daffy English "kniggits"...

1017
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:55,400
and Monsieur Arthur King
who has the brain of a duck.

1018
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:58,500
So we French fellows
outwit you a second time.

1019
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:02,100
How dare you profane this place
with your presence!

1020
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:06,200
I command you, in the name
of the Knights of Camelot...

1021
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:09,800
to open the doors
of this sacred castle...

1022
01:25:09,900 --> 01:25:12,800
to which God Himself has guided us!

1023
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:15,900
How you English say,
I one more time...

1024
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:19,900
unclog my nose in your direction,
sons of a window dresser.

1025
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,700
So you think you could
out-clever us French folk...

1026
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:26,100
with your silly knees-bent,
running-about advancing behavior!

1027
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:29,200
I wave my private parts
at your aunties...

1028
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:34,000
you cheesy lot of secondhand
electric-donkey bottom biters!

1029
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:36,300
In the name of the Lord...

1030
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:39,600
we demand entrance
to this sacred castle!

1031
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:42,300
No chance, English bed-wetting types.

1032
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:47,300
I burst my pimples at you and call
your door-opening request a silly thing.

1033
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:50,800
You tiny-brained wipers
of other people's bottoms!

1034
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:55,400
If you do not open this door,
we shall take this castle by force.

1035
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:59,500
In the name of God
and the glory of our...

1036
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:03,900
Right! That settles it!

1037
01:26:03,900 --> 01:26:07,100
Yes! Depart at this time
and cut the approaching...

1038
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:11,900
or we fire arrows into your heads and
make castanets out of your testicles.

1039
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,900
Walk away. Just ignore them.

1040
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:17,800
Now remain gone,
illegitimate-faced bugger folk!

1041
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:21,300
If you think you got
a nasty taunting this time...

1042
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:23,700
you ain't heard nothing yet...

1043
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:26,300
daffy English "kniggits"!

1044
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:50,900
- We shall attack at once!
- Yes, my Liege.

1045
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,100
Stand by for attack!

1046
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:54,100
French persons!

1047
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:59,300
Today the blood of many a valiant knight
shall be avenged!

1048
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:02,800
In the name of God,
we shall not stop our fight...

1049
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:05,500
till each one of you lies dead...

1050
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:07,500
and the Holy Grail...

1051
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:12,000
returns to those
whom God has chosen!

1052
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:14,000
Charge!

1053
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:43,400
Yes, they're the ones.
I'm sure.

1054
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:46,200
Don't let any of them go through.

1055
01:28:46,300 --> 01:28:48,200
That's them. Yes.

1056
01:28:48,300 --> 01:28:51,400
Move along. Come on.

1057
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:56,900
This one. Come on.
Put him in the van.

1058
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Get a blanket on that one.

1059
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:01,700
Come on, back.
Right back. Come on.

1060
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:06,100
Put that over there.
That's an offensive weapon, that is.

1061
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:07,800
Back. Come on.

1062
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:11,700
All right, sonny, that's enough.
Just pack that in.

1063
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:14,000
<i>Christ!</i>
