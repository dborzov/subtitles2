1
00:00:54,117 --> 00:00:55,416
Somebody asked me:

2
00:00:55,417 --> 00:00:58,546
"Phil, if you could be anywhere,
where would you be?"

3
00:00:58,776 --> 00:01:01,222
I said to him,
"Probably right here".

4
00:01:01,456 --> 00:01:04,426
EIko, Nevada."
Our nation's high at 79 today.

5
00:01:04,696 --> 00:01:07,223
In California, they'll have
warm weather tomorrow...

6
00:01:07,456 --> 00:01:09,982
Gang wars and some
overpriced real estate.

7
00:01:10,216 --> 00:01:12,947
In the Pacific Northwest,
they'll have some...

8
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:14,787
Very, very tall trees.

9
00:01:15,016 --> 00:01:17,462
Clear across the Rockies
and Great Plains.

10
00:01:17,696 --> 00:01:20,018
But look out, here comes trouble.

11
00:01:22,097 --> 00:01:23,098
Oh, boy!

12
00:01:23,657 --> 00:01:25,386
Front coming our way!
Look out!

13
00:01:25,817 --> 00:01:29,264
What will that mean to us?
One of these big, blue things!

14
00:01:29,497 --> 00:01:33,218
This cold, frigid arctic air,
this big mass out of the north.

15
00:01:34,096 --> 00:01:37,260
It'll meet up with all this
moisture out of the Gulf.

16
00:01:37,496 --> 00:01:39,783
They'll mix at high altitudes
and cause snow.

17
00:01:40,457 --> 00:01:45,258
It won't hit us here in Pittsburgh.
It'll push off and hit Altoona.

18
00:01:45,456 --> 00:01:46,504
Close call!

19
00:01:46,737 --> 00:01:48,341
Let's look at the five-day.

20
00:01:48,976 --> 00:01:51,821
As you can see, nothing to be
too scared about.

21
00:01:52,296 --> 00:01:55,619
Bundle up warm, but you can
leave your galoshes at home.

22
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:58,467
I won't be here at 10:00.
Tomorrow's Groundhog Day.

23
00:01:58,696 --> 00:02:03,020
I'll be in Punxsutawney for our
country's oldest groundhog festival.

24
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:06,340
According to the legend,
tomorrow, February 2nd...

25
00:02:06,617 --> 00:02:09,223
If the groundhog wakes
and sees his shadow...

26
00:02:09,417 --> 00:02:11,466
We've got six more weeks
of winter.

27
00:02:11,737 --> 00:02:12,738
Sounds like fun.

28
00:02:12,978 --> 00:02:16,380
You must really enjoy it.
This is your third year in a row.

29
00:02:16,617 --> 00:02:17,823
Four, Nan.

30
00:02:18,057 --> 00:02:18,979
Four.

31
00:02:19,217 --> 00:02:20,343
Thanks, Phil.

32
00:02:20,777 --> 00:02:25,066
Next, our entertainment editor
looks at sex and violence in movies.

33
00:02:25,297 --> 00:02:26,344
Stay with us.

34
00:02:29,297 --> 00:02:30,298
We're clear.

35
00:02:30,537 --> 00:02:32,346
Have fun in Punxsutawney.

36
00:02:33,297 --> 00:02:38,098
For your information, Hairdo,
a major network is interested in me.

37
00:02:38,336 --> 00:02:40,863
That would be the
Home Shopping Network.

38
00:02:42,176 --> 00:02:44,747
Thanks, Larry.
Go wait in the van.

39
00:02:45,297 --> 00:02:47,698
That was nice, Phil.
"Big trees"!

40
00:02:47,937 --> 00:02:48,779
Stop, Kenny.

41
00:02:48,977 --> 00:02:51,548
Look, can you handle
the 10:00 or not?

42
00:02:51,858 --> 00:02:55,748
If you don't want to rush back,
I can do the 5:00 tomorrow.

43
00:02:55,978 --> 00:02:58,821
Stay an extra second in Punxsutawney?
Please!

44
00:02:59,058 --> 00:03:01,185
Rita thinks it'd be
a great idea...

45
00:03:01,417 --> 00:03:04,661
To stay for other events.
You'll get incredible footage.

46
00:03:04,897 --> 00:03:07,138
The people and the fun.
The excitement!

47
00:03:07,378 --> 00:03:10,427
You haven't worked with her yet.
She's really nice.

48
00:03:10,617 --> 00:03:13,666
I think she'll be
a really good producer.

49
00:03:13,897 --> 00:03:16,218
You guys are going to have fun.

50
00:03:18,417 --> 00:03:22,422
She's fun. But not my kind of fun.
I'll be here for the 5:00.

51
00:04:22,018 --> 00:04:23,907
Can you keep a secret, Larry?

52
00:04:24,618 --> 00:04:26,507
I'm probably leaving PBH.

53
00:04:26,938 --> 00:04:29,464
So this will be the last time...

54
00:04:29,778 --> 00:04:31,223
We do the Groundhog together.

55
00:04:32,018 --> 00:04:34,589
What's wrong with
the Groundhog Festival?

56
00:04:34,818 --> 00:04:35,865
In San Diego...

57
00:04:36,098 --> 00:04:39,624
I covered the swallows returning
to Capistrano for six years.

58
00:04:40,258 --> 00:04:44,263
Someone will see me interview
a groundhog, think I have no future.

59
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,459
I think it's a nice story.

60
00:04:46,698 --> 00:04:49,383
He comes out.
He looks around.

61
00:04:49,578 --> 00:04:51,262
He wrinkles up his nose.

62
00:04:51,498 --> 00:04:55,138
He sees his shadow or not.
It's nice! People like it!

63
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,665
You are new, aren't you?

64
00:04:58,338 --> 00:05:00,420
People like blood sausage too.

65
00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:02,105
People are morons!

66
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:04,269
Nice attitude.

67
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,664
Look in the mirror and see how you
look when you do that groundhog thing.

68
00:05:08,899 --> 00:05:10,025
For me? Once?

69
00:05:10,219 --> 00:05:13,860
He comes out, and there he
looks at his little shadow.

70
00:05:15,219 --> 00:05:17,028
Want some blood sausage?
I have some...

71
00:05:17,219 --> 00:05:19,062
I like blood sausage.

72
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,390
Rita, I can't stay here.

73
00:06:18,859 --> 00:06:20,066
Prima donna.

74
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:22,428
-What's the matter?
-I hate this place.

75
00:06:22,619 --> 00:06:25,190
I stayed here two years ago.
I was miserable.

76
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,905
-I won't stay here.
-You're not staying here.

77
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:29,220
I'm not?

78
00:06:30,179 --> 00:06:31,385
Larry's dropping me off.

79
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:34,060
I booked you in
a nice bed-and-breakfast.

80
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,181
Great.

81
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,428
I think this is one of the traits
of a good producer.

82
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,304
Keep the talent happy.

83
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,939
Anything I can do.

84
00:06:44,299 --> 00:06:46,621
Would you help me
with my pelvic tilt?

85
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:51,942
Within reason. Want to come
to dinner with Larry and me?

86
00:06:52,619 --> 00:06:55,226
No, thank you.
I've seen Larry eat.

87
00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:00,146
You get your sleep.
See you in the morning.

88
00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:02,311
Don't be late.

89
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,901
Did he actually call himself
"the talent"?

90
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,342
Campers, rise and shine!
Don't forget your booties.

91
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,265
-It's cold out there!
-It's cold every day!

92
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,667
-Is this Miami Beach?
-Not hardly!

93
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,585
Expect hazardous travel
later today with...

94
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,185
That blizzard thing.

95
00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:50,423
That blizzard thing.
Here 's the report.

96
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:54,824
The National Weather Service
is calling for a big blizzard thing.

97
00:07:55,019 --> 00:07:57,705
There 's another reason
today 's especially exciting...

98
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,583
Especially cold.

99
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,147
The big question
on everybody's lips...

100
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:04,952
-Their chapped lips.
-On their chapped lips.

101
00:08:05,141 --> 00:08:07,667
Will Phil come out
and see his shadow?

102
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,064
-Punxsutawney Phil!
-That's right, woodchuck chuckers!

103
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,666
It's Groundhog Day!

104
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,824
Get up and chuck me a hog!

105
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,826
-Morning!
-Morning.

106
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,062
-Off to see the groundhog?
-I am.

107
00:08:23,261 --> 00:08:25,262
Think it'll be an early spring?

108
00:08:25,461 --> 00:08:27,462
I'm predicting March 21st.

109
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,831
Good guess!

110
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,548
I think that actually is
the first day of spring.

111
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,346
-Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?
-I slept alone, Mrs. Lancaster.

112
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,747
Like some coffee?

113
00:08:46,981 --> 00:08:51,269
Is there any possibility of getting
an espresso or cappuccino?

114
00:08:51,461 --> 00:08:53,384
I really don't know....

115
00:08:53,661 --> 00:08:57,063
How to spell espresso or cappuccino.
This looks fine.

116
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,383
I hope you enjoy the festivities.

117
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:02,750
-I'm sure I will.
-There's talk of a blizzard.

118
00:09:03,301 --> 00:09:06,350
We may catch a break and
it will blow right by.

119
00:09:06,581 --> 00:09:08,662
The moisture coming
out of the south...

120
00:09:08,901 --> 00:09:11,028
By midday will
push on to the east.

121
00:09:11,221 --> 00:09:16,022
At high altitudes it'll crystallize
and give us what we call snow.

122
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:19,862
Our high will get to
about 30 today, teens tonight.

123
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,668
Chance of precipitation,
about 20% today, 20% tomorrow.

124
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,790
Did you want to talk about
the weather or just chitchat?

125
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,661
Chitchat.

126
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,391
See you later.

127
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,624
Will you be checking out today?

128
00:09:35,822 --> 00:09:38,063
Chance of departure today, 100%.

129
00:09:59,821 --> 00:10:02,222
Phil Connors!
I thought that was you!

130
00:10:02,421 --> 00:10:04,627
How you doing?
Thanks for watching.

131
00:10:04,861 --> 00:10:09,184
Don't tell me you don't remember me.
I sure as heck fire remember you.

132
00:10:10,181 --> 00:10:11,262
Not a chance.

133
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,826
Ned!

134
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,506
Ryerson!

135
00:10:16,301 --> 00:10:17,986
Needlenose Ned.
Ned the Head.

136
00:10:18,181 --> 00:10:20,502
Come on, buddy.
Case Western High!

137
00:10:20,702 --> 00:10:24,468
I did the whistling bellybutton
trick at the talent show.

138
00:10:24,701 --> 00:10:29,390
Bing! Got the shingles real bad
senior year. Almost didn't graduate.

139
00:10:29,661 --> 00:10:31,470
Bing again!

140
00:10:31,662 --> 00:10:35,586
I dated your sister a couple times
till you told me not to anymore.

141
00:10:35,781 --> 00:10:37,022
Well?

142
00:10:37,821 --> 00:10:38,663
Ned Ryerson?

143
00:10:38,902 --> 00:10:39,823
Bing!

144
00:10:40,062 --> 00:10:41,301
Bing.

145
00:10:42,101 --> 00:10:44,911
Did you turn pro with
that bellybutton thing?

146
00:10:45,101 --> 00:10:46,432
I sell insurance.

147
00:10:46,661 --> 00:10:48,823
-What a shock.
-Do you have insurance?

148
00:10:49,021 --> 00:10:50,910
If you do, you could
always use more.

149
00:10:51,101 --> 00:10:53,627
Am I right or am I right
or am I right?

150
00:10:55,381 --> 00:10:58,224
I would love to stand here
and talk with you.

151
00:10:58,421 --> 00:10:59,662
But I'm not going to.

152
00:10:59,902 --> 00:11:00,824
See you.

153
00:11:01,062 --> 00:11:02,826
That's all right!
I'll walk with you.

154
00:11:03,022 --> 00:11:05,831
I see an opportunity,
I charge it like a bull.

155
00:11:06,062 --> 00:11:07,826
Ned the Bull, that's me now.

156
00:11:08,061 --> 00:11:11,463
I got friends who Iive and die
by the actuarial tables.

157
00:11:11,702 --> 00:11:14,626
I say it's all one big
crapshoot anyhoo.

158
00:11:14,822 --> 00:11:19,544
Ever heard of single-premium life?
That could be the ticket for you.

159
00:11:19,781 --> 00:11:21,147
Oh, God!

160
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:25,147
It is so good to see you!
What are you doing for dinner?

161
00:11:25,382 --> 00:11:26,621
Something else.

162
00:11:26,822 --> 00:11:30,190
It's been great seeing you,
Needlehead. Take care.

163
00:11:34,181 --> 00:11:37,663
Watch out for that first step.
It's a doozy!

164
00:12:05,382 --> 00:12:06,429
Phil!

165
00:12:06,621 --> 00:12:08,191
Phil, over here!

166
00:12:08,501 --> 00:12:09,833
Where have you been?

167
00:12:10,061 --> 00:12:11,551
It was horrible.

168
00:12:11,782 --> 00:12:13,625
A giant leech got me.

169
00:12:14,102 --> 00:12:16,343
You're missing all the fun.
These people are great!

170
00:12:16,582 --> 00:12:20,064
Some of them partied all night.
They sing till they get cold.

171
00:12:20,261 --> 00:12:22,788
Then they go sit by the fire
and get warm.

172
00:12:22,981 --> 00:12:25,303
Then they come back
and sing some more!

173
00:12:26,102 --> 00:12:27,830
They're hicks, Rita.

174
00:12:28,661 --> 00:12:30,869
So, did you sleep okay without me?

175
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,786
You tossed and turned, didn't you?

176
00:12:32,983 --> 00:12:34,144
You're incredible.

177
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:35,543
Who told you?

178
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,708
It's groundhog time.

179
00:12:42,382 --> 00:12:44,111
Okay.
On me in three...

180
00:12:44,302 --> 00:12:45,952
Two, one.

181
00:12:46,862 --> 00:12:51,424
Once a year, the eyes of the nation
turn to this tiny hamlet...

182
00:12:51,662 --> 00:12:53,232
To watch a master at work.

183
00:12:53,462 --> 00:12:54,349
The master?

184
00:12:54,582 --> 00:12:55,868
Punxsutawney Phil...

185
00:12:56,102 --> 00:12:59,265
The world's most famous weatherman.
The groundhog.

186
00:12:59,501 --> 00:13:03,473
Who, as legend has it,
can predict an early spring.

187
00:13:03,702 --> 00:13:06,273
The question we have
to ask ourselves is:

188
00:13:06,502 --> 00:13:08,425
"Does Phil feel Iucky?"

189
00:13:10,462 --> 00:13:14,435
Every year, the guy comes with
a big stick and raps on the door.

190
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:17,274
They pull the little rat out,
talk to him.

191
00:13:17,504 --> 00:13:20,666
The rat talks back.
Then they tell us when it'll end.

192
00:13:26,823 --> 00:13:28,553
Isn't he cute?

193
00:13:30,503 --> 00:13:33,792
Do you like the guys
with the prominent upper teeth?

194
00:13:43,863 --> 00:13:47,629
This February 2nd, at 7:20
and 30 seconds...

195
00:13:47,824 --> 00:13:49,234
Punxsutawney Phil...

196
00:13:49,463 --> 00:13:50,953
The seer of seers...

197
00:13:51,183 --> 00:13:54,027
Prognosticator of prognosticators...

198
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,147
Emerged reluctantly...

199
00:13:56,383 --> 00:13:57,384
But alertly...

200
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,552
In Punxsutawney, PA...

201
00:13:59,864 --> 00:14:02,344
And stated in groundhog-ese...

202
00:14:02,584 --> 00:14:04,666
"Definitely see a shadow."

203
00:14:07,424 --> 00:14:11,065
Sorry, folks.
Six more weeks of winter.

204
00:14:16,304 --> 00:14:18,989
On me in three, two, one.

205
00:14:20,304 --> 00:14:22,511
This is one time where
television fails...

206
00:14:22,703 --> 00:14:25,469
To capture the excitement
of a large squirrel...

207
00:14:25,703 --> 00:14:26,864
Predicting the weather.

208
00:14:27,104 --> 00:14:30,266
I'm grateful to have been here.
From Punxsutawney...

209
00:14:30,504 --> 00:14:33,075
This is Phil Connors.
So long.

210
00:14:33,263 --> 00:14:35,346
Want to try it again
without the sarcasm?

211
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,030
We got it.
I'm out of here.

212
00:14:38,863 --> 00:14:40,467
Prima donnas.

213
00:14:52,664 --> 00:14:55,144
Oh, boy.
Take a look at this.

214
00:14:56,225 --> 00:14:57,828
What is going on?

215
00:14:58,024 --> 00:15:01,824
I don't know. Perhaps that
blizzard we're not supposed to get.

216
00:15:02,104 --> 00:15:03,868
This is impossible.

217
00:15:05,703 --> 00:15:08,674
Nobody honks this horn but me,
okay, pal?

218
00:15:29,184 --> 00:15:30,629
Take it out of here.

219
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,352
Commander, what's going on?

220
00:15:33,585 --> 00:15:35,632
Nothing.
We're closing the road.

221
00:15:35,865 --> 00:15:39,312
-Big blizzard moving in.
-It's a couple of flakes.

222
00:15:39,784 --> 00:15:42,105
Don't you listen to the weather?

223
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,228
I make the weather.

224
00:15:44,424 --> 00:15:49,225
All this moisture from the Gulf
will push off to the east in Altoona.

225
00:15:49,505 --> 00:15:51,825
You got that moisture on your head.

226
00:15:52,105 --> 00:15:53,947
You can go back to Punxsutawney...

227
00:15:54,584 --> 00:15:57,349
Or you can freeze to death.
It's your choice.

228
00:15:57,664 --> 00:15:59,632
So, what's it going to be?

229
00:16:02,464 --> 00:16:03,590
I'm thinking.

230
00:16:04,184 --> 00:16:07,631
Come on, all the long-distance
lines are down?

231
00:16:08,424 --> 00:16:09,835
What about the satellite?

232
00:16:10,064 --> 00:16:11,908
Is it snowing in space?

233
00:16:13,025 --> 00:16:17,189
Don't you keep a line open
for emergencies or celebrities?

234
00:16:18,264 --> 00:16:21,508
I'm both.
I'm a celebrity in an emergency.

235
00:16:22,104 --> 00:16:24,392
Can you patch me through
on that line?

236
00:16:31,345 --> 00:16:34,428
Could I have one more of these
with some booze in it?

237
00:16:35,505 --> 00:16:37,030
I like it here.

238
00:16:38,424 --> 00:16:40,347
Going to the groundhog dinner?

239
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:42,234
No, I had groundhog for lunch.

240
00:16:42,424 --> 00:16:44,632
Wasn't bad.
Tastes like chicken.

241
00:16:44,824 --> 00:16:46,667
You two run along.

242
00:16:47,904 --> 00:16:49,907
Looking foxy tonight, man.

243
00:16:50,424 --> 00:16:53,473
Is your troop selling
cookies again this year?

244
00:16:53,705 --> 00:16:54,944
That's so funny.

245
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,596
So, what are you doing?

246
00:16:57,106 --> 00:16:59,233
I think I'll go back to my room...

247
00:16:59,465 --> 00:17:02,867
Take a hot shower
and maybe read Hustler.

248
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:04,430
Suit yourself.

249
00:17:22,305 --> 00:17:23,352
Yo, mom.

250
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:25,235
Isn't there any hot water?

251
00:17:25,465 --> 00:17:27,274
Oh, no, there wouldn't be today.

252
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:29,872
Of course not.
Silly me.

253
00:17:30,064 --> 00:17:31,476
Sweet dreams.

254
00:17:54,186 --> 00:17:57,190
Campers, rise and shine!
Don't forget your booties.

255
00:17:57,425 --> 00:18:00,474
-It's cold out there!
-It's cold every day!

256
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,470
-Is this Miami Beach?
-Not hardly!

257
00:18:02,705 --> 00:18:05,868
Nice going, boys.
You're playing yesterday's tape.

258
00:18:06,105 --> 00:18:07,516
 with that blizzard thing.

259
00:18:07,745 --> 00:18:10,316
That blizzard thing?
Here 's the report.

260
00:18:10,505 --> 00:18:14,829
The National Weather Service
is calling for a big blizzard thing.

261
00:18:15,025 --> 00:18:17,915
There 's another reason
today 's especially exciting...

262
00:18:18,105 --> 00:18:20,073
Especially cold.

263
00:18:20,304 --> 00:18:22,387
The big question
on everybody's lips...

264
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,071
-Chapped lips.
-Their chapped lips.

265
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:28,071
Will Phil come out
and see his shadow?

266
00:18:28,265 --> 00:18:31,475
-Punxsutawney Phil!
-That's right, woodchuck chuckers!

267
00:18:31,665 --> 00:18:32,997
It's Groundhog Day!

268
00:18:33,185 --> 00:18:34,836
Get up and chuck me a hog!

269
00:18:39,826 --> 00:18:41,316
What the hell?

270
00:18:49,025 --> 00:18:51,835
Morning!
Off to see the groundhog?

271
00:18:53,385 --> 00:18:55,069
Think it'll be an early spring?

272
00:18:55,905 --> 00:18:57,714
Didn't we do this yesterday?

273
00:18:58,305 --> 00:18:59,716
I don't know what you mean.

274
00:19:00,585 --> 00:19:02,508
Don't mess with me, Pork Chop!

275
00:19:02,865 --> 00:19:05,835
-What day is this?
-It's February 2nd.

276
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,556
Groundhog Day.

277
00:19:10,346 --> 00:19:13,156
I'm sorry.
I thought it was yesterday.

278
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,667
Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?

279
00:19:37,226 --> 00:19:38,875
Did I sleep well?

280
00:19:39,146 --> 00:19:40,750
Like some coffee?

281
00:19:40,986 --> 00:19:43,556
Yes, please.
I think I'll have a double.

282
00:19:43,825 --> 00:19:46,112
I hope you enjoy the festivities.

283
00:19:46,505 --> 00:19:48,668
There's talk of a blizzard.

284
00:19:51,226 --> 00:19:53,307
Ever have deja vu,
Mrs. Lancaster?

285
00:19:53,546 --> 00:19:56,072
I'll check with the kitchen.

286
00:19:56,346 --> 00:19:58,155
That's okay.
Thank you.

287
00:19:59,547 --> 00:20:02,117
Will you be checking out today?

288
00:20:04,306 --> 00:20:08,436
I'd say the chance
of departure is 80 percent.

289
00:20:09,586 --> 00:20:11,236
75 to 80.

290
00:20:16,226 --> 00:20:17,637
Excuse me!

291
00:20:18,386 --> 00:20:20,548
Excuse me.
Where's everybody going?

292
00:20:21,106 --> 00:20:22,517
To Gobbler's Knob.

293
00:20:22,705 --> 00:20:23,912
It's Groundhog Day.

294
00:20:24,706 --> 00:20:27,027
It's still just once a year,
isn't it?

295
00:20:38,826 --> 00:20:41,068
Phil Connors!
I thought that was you!

296
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:43,469
My, oh my, Phil Connors!

297
00:20:43,707 --> 00:20:47,473
Don't say you don't remember me.
I sure as heck fire remember you.

298
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:50,067
-Well?
-Ned Ryerson?

299
00:20:50,306 --> 00:20:53,516
Bing! First shot
right out of the box!

300
00:20:53,706 --> 00:20:56,233
So how's it going, old buddy?

301
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:59,238
I'm not feeling well.
Would you excuse me?

302
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:04,074
It's funny you should mention
your health. Guess what I do now.

303
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:06,229
Do you sell insurance?

304
00:21:06,507 --> 00:21:09,237
Bing again!
You are sharp as a tack today!

305
00:21:09,466 --> 00:21:11,230
Do you have life insurance?

306
00:21:11,466 --> 00:21:13,674
If you do, you could
always use more.

307
00:21:13,906 --> 00:21:15,749
Right! I mean, who couldn't?

308
00:21:15,986 --> 00:21:17,272
But you want to know something?

309
00:21:17,506 --> 00:21:19,430
I got a feeling...

310
00:21:19,907 --> 00:21:21,272
You ain't got any.

311
00:21:21,507 --> 00:21:24,239
Am I right or am I right
or am I right?

312
00:21:24,428 --> 00:21:25,759
I got to go.

313
00:21:30,028 --> 00:21:33,828
Watch out for that first step.
It's a doozy!

314
00:21:56,827 --> 00:21:59,752
Phil! Over here!

315
00:22:01,827 --> 00:22:04,398
-Where have you been?
-Rita. Do me a favour.

316
00:22:04,587 --> 00:22:07,591
I need someone to give me a
good, hard slap in the face.

317
00:22:09,189 --> 00:22:10,553
How's that?

318
00:22:10,749 --> 00:22:11,556
Good!

319
00:22:12,028 --> 00:22:15,350
If you need help with the other cheek,
I'm right here.

320
00:22:16,948 --> 00:22:18,359
Something's going on.

321
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:21,199
-Are you drunk or something?
-Drunk's more fun.

322
00:22:21,428 --> 00:22:23,351
Can I be serious with you
for a minute?

323
00:22:23,548 --> 00:22:24,629
Can you?

324
00:22:24,828 --> 00:22:26,592
I'm being serious!

325
00:22:26,828 --> 00:22:30,674
I'm having a problem.
I may behaving a problem.

326
00:22:31,908 --> 00:22:33,034
It's groundhog time.

327
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:35,390
See? I knew you'd say that!

328
00:22:35,788 --> 00:22:37,278
I really feel...

329
00:22:37,508 --> 00:22:38,873
Weird.

330
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:41,315
Let's just do this.
Then we'll talk.

331
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:44,953
All right, on me in three...

332
00:22:45,428 --> 00:22:46,918
Two, one.

333
00:22:47,507 --> 00:22:49,158
Well, it's Groundhog Day...

334
00:22:49,387 --> 00:22:50,674
Again...

335
00:22:50,907 --> 00:22:53,674
And that must mean we're
up here at Gobbler's Knob...

336
00:22:53,908 --> 00:22:57,516
Waiting for the world's most famous
groundhog weatherman...

337
00:22:57,708 --> 00:22:58,995
Punxsutawney Phil...

338
00:22:59,228 --> 00:23:03,028
Who's gonna tell us how much more
winter to expect.

339
00:23:08,509 --> 00:23:09,839
This is a riot!

340
00:23:13,228 --> 00:23:14,354
Isn't he cute?

341
00:23:15,428 --> 00:23:19,150
This February 2nd, at 7:20
and 30 seconds...

342
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:22,918
Punxsutawney Phil,
the seer of seers...

343
00:23:23,428 --> 00:23:25,874
Prognosticator of prognosticators...

344
00:23:26,348 --> 00:23:27,998
Emerged reluctantly...

345
00:23:28,228 --> 00:23:30,390
But alertly in Punxsu...

346
00:23:32,788 --> 00:23:34,756
Oh, my gosh!

347
00:23:37,228 --> 00:23:39,152
I know there's a blizzard.

348
00:23:39,389 --> 00:23:42,359
When will the long-distance
lines be repaired?

349
00:23:44,148 --> 00:23:48,154
What if there is no tomorrow?
There wasn't one today.

350
00:24:42,909 --> 00:24:43,876
Morning!

351
00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:45,599
Off to see the groundhog?

352
00:24:51,909 --> 00:24:53,911
Did you sleep well, Mr....

353
00:25:07,789 --> 00:25:09,758
Phil Connors! I thought...

354
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:14,359
Don't say you don't remember me.
I sure as heck fire remember you!

355
00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:16,552
It's me, Ned! Ryerson!

356
00:25:16,749 --> 00:25:19,150
Needlenose Ned! Ned the Head!

357
00:25:23,309 --> 00:25:25,789
Phil! Over here!

358
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:29,953
Can I talk to you?
It's not work-related.

359
00:25:30,149 --> 00:25:32,959
-You never talk about work.
-We have to talk.

360
00:25:33,149 --> 00:25:36,153
-It's a creative meeting.
-We've got work to do!

361
00:25:36,349 --> 00:25:38,670
I don't.
I've already done it twice.

362
00:25:38,909 --> 00:25:41,753
When you get finished,
meet me in the diner.

363
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:47,079
-What's that all about?
-I don't know.

364
00:25:47,308 --> 00:25:48,833
Prima donnas.

365
00:25:52,269 --> 00:25:53,237
More coffee?

366
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:57,115
Just the check, please.
These sticky buns are heaven.

367
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,755
Aren't they?

368
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:02,436
Just put that anywhere, pal!

369
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:04,155
Good save!

370
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:08,918
Tell me why you're too sick to work.
It better be good.

371
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:14,751
I'm reliving the same day
over and over.

372
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:17,350
Groundhog Day. Today.

373
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:20,958
Okay. I'm waiting for the punch line.

374
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:23,994
Really! This is the third time!

375
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:26,119
It's like yesterday never happened!

376
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:30,156
I'm racking my brain trying to imagine
why you'd make this up.

377
00:26:31,029 --> 00:26:33,600
I'm not making it up.
I'm asking for help!

378
00:26:34,229 --> 00:26:36,038
What do you want me to do?

379
00:26:36,229 --> 00:26:39,439
I don't know! You're a producer.
Come up with something.

380
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:42,156
You should get
your head examined...

381
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:45,553
If you expect me to believe
a stupid story like that!

382
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,480
Phil? Like the groundhog Phil?

383
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:50,270
Yeah. Like the groundhog Phil.

384
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,992
Look out for your shadow, pal!

385
00:26:53,829 --> 00:26:55,672
Morons, your bus is leaving!

386
00:26:56,710 --> 00:27:00,191
You guys ready? We better go,
to stay ahead of the weather.

387
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:04,798
-Let's talk about it in Pittsburgh.
-I'm not going back to Pittsburgh.

388
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:07,198
-Why not?
-Because of the blizzard!

389
00:27:07,469 --> 00:27:09,790
You said it was going
to hit Altoona.

390
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:12,561
I know that's what I said.

391
00:27:13,189 --> 00:27:15,158
I think you need help.

392
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:18,879
That's what I've been saying.
I need help.

393
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,394
No spots.

394
00:27:21,631 --> 00:27:23,997
No clots, no tumors.

395
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,561
No lesions.

396
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,275
No aneurysms.

397
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:29,000
At least none that I can see.

398
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:32,951
If you want a CAT scan or an MRI,
you'll have to go into Pittsburgh.

399
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:35,278
I can't go into Pittsburgh.

400
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:38,957
-Why can't you go into Pittsburgh?
-I told you, there's a blizzard.

401
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:40,356
Right. The blizzard!

402
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:43,161
You know what you may need,
Mr. Connors?

403
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:45,196
A biopsy.

404
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,359
A psychiatrist.

405
00:27:48,949 --> 00:27:51,396
That's an unusual problem...

406
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:52,677
Mr. Connors.

407
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:58,913
Most of my work is with couples,
families. I have an alcoholic now.

408
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:02,834
You went to college, right?

409
00:28:03,029 --> 00:28:05,270
It wasn't veterinary
psychology, was it?

410
00:28:05,511 --> 00:28:08,355
Didn't you take a course that
covered this stuff?

411
00:28:08,551 --> 00:28:10,951
Sort of, I guess.

412
00:28:12,551 --> 00:28:14,235
Abnormal psychology.

413
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:16,519
$0...

414
00:28:17,591 --> 00:28:18,830
What do I do?

415
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:20,917
We should meet again.

416
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,753
How's tomorrow for you?

417
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:27,721
Is that not good?

418
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:40,795
I was in the Virgin Islands once.

419
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:42,954
I meta girl.

420
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:44,390
We ate lobster.

421
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:46,553
Drank pina coladas.

422
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:49,236
At sunset, we made love
like sea otters.

423
00:28:52,911 --> 00:28:55,152
That was a pretty good day.

424
00:28:55,391 --> 00:28:57,155
Why couldn't I get that day...

425
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,432
..over'...

426
00:28:58,631 --> 00:29:00,758
And over and over?

427
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:04,752
Some guys would look
at this glass and say:

428
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,362
"That glass is half empty."

429
00:29:06,591 --> 00:29:10,231
Other guys would say,
"That glass is half full."

430
00:29:10,471 --> 00:29:13,679
I peg you as a "glass is half empty"
kind of guy. Right?

431
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:18,800
What would you do if you were
stuck in one place".

432
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:22,796
And every day was exactly the same,
and nothing you did mattered?

433
00:29:25,271 --> 00:29:27,922
That about sums it up for me.

434
00:29:35,192 --> 00:29:36,159
Good luck.

435
00:29:36,392 --> 00:29:37,757
I'll drop you off.

436
00:29:39,832 --> 00:29:41,960
This thing sticks a little bit.

437
00:29:42,192 --> 00:29:43,637
You got to jiggle it...

438
00:29:43,872 --> 00:29:45,954
Come on up here, pal.

439
00:29:46,152 --> 00:29:48,519
Give me your keys, pal.
Give me the keys.

440
00:29:48,712 --> 00:29:51,362
Friends don't let friends drive, right?
Stand up here.

441
00:29:51,552 --> 00:29:54,395
Take a deep breath. You feel okay?

442
00:29:54,632 --> 00:29:55,963
You're all right.

443
00:30:02,192 --> 00:30:04,763
You want to throw up here
or in the car?

444
00:30:05,112 --> 00:30:07,558
I think, both.

445
00:30:18,271 --> 00:30:20,161
I don't think I should drive.

446
00:30:20,393 --> 00:30:22,202
I don't either.

447
00:30:22,432 --> 00:30:23,764
Watch your head.

448
00:30:23,952 --> 00:30:27,001
Watch your knees.
Don't break anything.

449
00:30:27,233 --> 00:30:29,280
Let's not forget seat belts.

450
00:30:31,152 --> 00:30:34,156
Who else could go for some
flapjacks right now?

451
00:30:39,192 --> 00:30:40,843
Let me ask you a question.

452
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:41,914
Shoot.

453
00:30:43,352 --> 00:30:45,275
What if there were no tomorrow?

454
00:30:45,792 --> 00:30:48,955
No tomorrow? That means there'd be
no consequences...

455
00:30:49,192 --> 00:30:50,682
No hangovers.

456
00:30:50,912 --> 00:30:53,279
We could do whatever we wanted!

457
00:30:54,632 --> 00:30:55,962
That's true.

458
00:30:56,152 --> 00:30:59,156
We could do whatever we want.

459
00:31:04,513 --> 00:31:07,915
If we wanted to hit mailboxes,
we could let Ralph drive!

460
00:31:14,433 --> 00:31:15,958
They want you to stop.

461
00:31:16,153 --> 00:31:17,040
Hang on!

462
00:31:22,552 --> 00:31:24,475
It's the same thing
your whole life.

463
00:31:24,913 --> 00:31:27,722
"Clean up your room! Stand up
straight! Pick up your feet!"

464
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:29,642
Take it like a man!

465
00:31:29,833 --> 00:31:31,437
Be nice to your sister!

466
00:31:32,233 --> 00:31:34,633
Don't mix beer and wine, ever!

467
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:38,480
"Don't drive on the railroad tracks!"

468
00:31:39,992 --> 00:31:41,233
That's one I agree with.

469
00:31:50,433 --> 00:31:52,481
I don't know, Gus.

470
00:31:52,713 --> 00:31:55,364
Sometimes I think you just have to...

471
00:31:55,593 --> 00:31:57,880
Take the big chances.

472
00:31:58,273 --> 00:32:00,355
This is the police! Pull over now!

473
00:32:01,673 --> 00:32:03,801
We're talking in here!

474
00:32:08,753 --> 00:32:10,596
I bet he swerves first.

475
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:27,396
I'm not going to live by
their rules anymore!

476
00:32:27,593 --> 00:32:29,163
I noticed that.

477
00:32:29,352 --> 00:32:31,799
You make choices
and you Iive with them.

478
00:32:45,914 --> 00:32:46,880
My knee!

479
00:32:49,633 --> 00:32:51,362
Let me handle this.

480
00:32:53,834 --> 00:32:56,485
Three cheeseburgers,
two large fries...

481
00:32:56,713 --> 00:32:58,636
Two chocolate shakes
and one large Coke.

482
00:32:58,913 --> 00:33:00,756
What is this, Miami Beach?
Not hardly!

483
00:33:00,993 --> 00:33:02,757
Too early for flapjacks?

484
00:33:15,753 --> 00:33:16,992
Yes!

485
00:33:18,154 --> 00:33:19,758
Rise and shine, campers!

486
00:33:19,993 --> 00:33:22,884
Don't forget your booties!
It's cold out there today!

487
00:33:23,114 --> 00:33:24,445
It's cold every day.

488
00:33:24,674 --> 00:33:27,643
What is this, Miami Beach?
Not hardly!

489
00:33:32,033 --> 00:33:33,399
Slept like a baby.

490
00:33:33,633 --> 00:33:35,556
I'd love some of your coffee.

491
00:33:35,793 --> 00:33:37,522
-I hope...
-Flurries moving in Iater...

492
00:33:37,713 --> 00:33:39,795
But the blizzard's going to hit
outside of town.

493
00:33:40,033 --> 00:33:41,001
Mrs. Lancaster?

494
00:33:41,233 --> 00:33:43,440
Was anybody looking for me
here this morning?

495
00:33:43,674 --> 00:33:46,961
Perhaps a state official?
Maybe a blue hat, gun, nightstick?

496
00:33:47,153 --> 00:33:49,963
No, no one like that!
Will there be?

497
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,757
Apparently not.

498
00:33:53,793 --> 00:33:57,036
Will you hold my room for me?
I'm staying an extra day.

499
00:34:02,634 --> 00:34:04,557
Catch you tomorrow, pops.

500
00:34:09,833 --> 00:34:11,962
-Phil Connors!
-Ned?

501
00:34:41,953 --> 00:34:45,242
I like to see a man of advancing years
throw caution to the wind.

502
00:34:45,433 --> 00:34:47,641
It's inspiring, in a way.

503
00:34:48,394 --> 00:34:50,761
My years are not advancing
as fast as you think.

504
00:34:51,394 --> 00:34:52,202
More coffee?

505
00:34:52,835 --> 00:34:53,961
Keep it coming.

506
00:34:54,274 --> 00:34:55,355
Sure thing.

507
00:34:57,114 --> 00:34:59,401
Just put that anywhere, pal!

508
00:34:59,754 --> 00:35:00,960
Good save!

509
00:35:02,954 --> 00:35:06,561
Don't you worry about cholesterol,
lung cancer, love handles?

510
00:35:08,794 --> 00:35:10,444
I don't worry anymore.

511
00:35:10,874 --> 00:35:13,081
What makes you special?
Everybody worries.

512
00:35:13,514 --> 00:35:16,040
That's exactly what makes me
so special.

513
00:35:16,234 --> 00:35:17,963
I don't even have to floss.

514
00:35:27,353 --> 00:35:28,196
What?

515
00:35:30,033 --> 00:35:33,562
The wretch, concentred all in self

516
00:35:33,955 --> 00:35:36,196
Living, shall forfeit fair renown

517
00:35:36,595 --> 00:35:39,404
And doubly dying, shall go down

518
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:42,484
To the vile dust from whence he sprung

519
00:35:42,715 --> 00:35:44,045
Unwept...

520
00:35:44,235 --> 00:35:46,601
Unhonored and unsung

521
00:35:47,195 --> 00:35:49,163
Sir Walter Scott.

522
00:35:52,155 --> 00:35:53,519
You don't like poetry?

523
00:35:54,234 --> 00:35:55,566
I love poetry!

524
00:35:55,754 --> 00:35:58,758
I just thought that was Willard Scott.
I was confused.

525
00:35:59,234 --> 00:36:01,602
You think I act like this
because I'm egocentric?

526
00:36:01,834 --> 00:36:04,883
You are egocentric.
It's your defining characteristic.

527
00:36:07,034 --> 00:36:10,561
You guys ready? We better go,
to stay ahead of the weather.

528
00:36:10,754 --> 00:36:11,596
Thanks, Larry.

529
00:36:11,834 --> 00:36:13,962
Would you like a doggie bag?

530
00:36:14,394 --> 00:36:15,759
I'll stay and finish.

531
00:36:15,954 --> 00:36:18,162
I thought you hated this town.

532
00:36:18,355 --> 00:36:20,163
It's beginning to grow on me.

533
00:36:21,435 --> 00:36:22,675
Larry, quit staring.

534
00:36:22,995 --> 00:36:25,760
-These are excellent.
-Bon appétit.

535
00:36:35,794 --> 00:36:37,956
You see the groundhog
this morning?

536
00:36:39,554 --> 00:36:41,159
I never miss it.

537
00:36:41,434 --> 00:36:42,959
What's your name?

538
00:36:44,754 --> 00:36:46,756
Nancy Taylor. And you are?

539
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:49,400
-What high school did you go to?
-What?

540
00:36:49,595 --> 00:36:50,595
High school.

541
00:36:51,914 --> 00:36:54,394
Lincoln, in Pittsburgh.
Who are you?

542
00:36:54,594 --> 00:36:57,677
Who was your 12th grade
English teacher?

543
00:36:57,915 --> 00:36:59,245
Are you kidding?

544
00:36:59,474 --> 00:37:01,603
In 12th grade,
your English teacher was...

545
00:37:01,795 --> 00:37:03,638
Mrs. Walsh.

546
00:37:03,835 --> 00:37:06,759
Nancy. Lincoln. Walsh.

547
00:37:07,395 --> 00:37:09,363
Thanks very much.

548
00:37:23,835 --> 00:37:25,360
Nancy?

549
00:37:26,195 --> 00:37:28,561
Nancy Taylor!

550
00:37:29,035 --> 00:37:31,163
Lincoln High School!

551
00:37:31,555 --> 00:37:34,764
I sat next to you in
Mrs. Walsh's English class!

552
00:37:35,195 --> 00:37:38,358
-I'm sorry.
-Phil Connors!

553
00:37:39,635 --> 00:37:41,957
-That's amazing!
-You don't remember me?

554
00:37:44,636 --> 00:37:46,127
I asked you to the prom.

555
00:37:47,317 --> 00:37:49,000
Phil Connors?

556
00:37:49,516 --> 00:37:51,644
I was short and I've sprouted.

557
00:37:55,916 --> 00:37:57,520
How are you?

558
00:37:58,196 --> 00:37:59,197
Great.

559
00:37:59,437 --> 00:38:01,086
You look terrific!

560
00:38:01,357 --> 00:38:04,406
You look very, very terrific!

561
00:38:05,836 --> 00:38:08,157
Listen, I got to go do this report.

562
00:38:08,356 --> 00:38:09,562
Are you a reporter?

563
00:38:09,756 --> 00:38:12,157
A weatherman with
Channel 9, Pittsburgh.

564
00:38:12,396 --> 00:38:14,239
I should have known! That's great!

565
00:38:14,516 --> 00:38:16,120
But maybe later we could....

566
00:38:16,316 --> 00:38:17,522
Yeah, whatever!

567
00:38:17,836 --> 00:38:19,440
Stay right here.

568
00:38:19,836 --> 00:38:22,885
Promise me?
I'll be right back. Wish me luck!

569
00:38:23,116 --> 00:38:24,766
Good luck!

570
00:38:41,916 --> 00:38:43,157
Oh, Phil.

571
00:38:44,156 --> 00:38:45,488
Oh, Rita.

572
00:38:49,196 --> 00:38:50,357
Who's Rita?

573
00:38:50,837 --> 00:38:52,362
How should I know?

574
00:38:52,636 --> 00:38:55,082
What is this,
some kind of one-night stand?

575
00:38:55,317 --> 00:38:57,206
On the contrary, Nancy...

576
00:38:57,436 --> 00:39:00,565
I love you.
I've always loved you.

577
00:39:01,316 --> 00:39:03,718
This is going to seem sudden but...

578
00:39:05,036 --> 00:39:06,959
Nancy, will you be my wife?

579
00:39:13,557 --> 00:39:14,968
Rita.

580
00:39:15,757 --> 00:39:18,158
-Nancy.
-Whatever.

581
00:39:22,437 --> 00:39:24,564
A gust of wind.

582
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:27,966
A dog barks.

583
00:39:29,237 --> 00:39:30,647
Cue the truck.

584
00:39:38,037 --> 00:39:39,198
Exit Herman.

585
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,686
Walk on to the bank.

586
00:39:41,917 --> 00:39:45,807
Exit Felix, and stand there with a
not-so-bright look on your face.

587
00:39:47,636 --> 00:39:49,559
All right, Doris. Come on.

588
00:39:50,197 --> 00:39:53,006
Fix your bra, honey.
That's better.

589
00:39:53,957 --> 00:39:55,321
Felix!

590
00:39:55,556 --> 00:39:56,922
How you doing, Doris?

591
00:39:57,116 --> 00:39:59,598
Can I have a roll of quarters?

592
00:40:00,758 --> 00:40:05,206
Ten...nine...eight...

593
00:40:05,877 --> 00:40:07,164
Cal'...

594
00:40:07,357 --> 00:40:10,327
Six...five...

595
00:40:10,557 --> 00:40:12,605
Quarters...

596
00:40:12,957 --> 00:40:16,404
Three...two....

597
00:40:23,877 --> 00:40:25,002
Felix?

598
00:40:25,197 --> 00:40:28,644
-Did I bring out two bags or one?
-I don't know.

599
00:40:54,798 --> 00:40:57,243
I thought we were going
to a costume party.

600
00:40:57,478 --> 00:41:00,242
It's like I said, I love this film.

601
00:41:00,478 --> 00:41:02,605
I've seen it over 100 times.

602
00:41:02,837 --> 00:41:03,805
Phil!

603
00:41:04,037 --> 00:41:05,243
Told you...

604
00:41:05,477 --> 00:41:07,640
Call me "Bronco."

605
00:41:07,877 --> 00:41:09,606
Sorry, Bronco.

606
00:41:10,797 --> 00:41:12,401
Hi, Nancy.

607
00:41:16,437 --> 00:41:18,326
My own fiancée...

608
00:41:18,557 --> 00:41:20,605
Doesn't remember me.

609
00:41:23,597 --> 00:41:26,043
That'll be one adult and...

610
00:41:26,277 --> 00:41:29,407
-Two adults.
-Two adults, I guess.

611
00:41:32,078 --> 00:41:37,005
 groundhog who, as legend has it,
can predict an early spring.

612
00:41:37,197 --> 00:41:39,848
The question we have
to ask ourselves today is:

613
00:41:40,078 --> 00:41:41,967
"Does Phil feel Iucky?"

614
00:41:42,157 --> 00:41:44,843
Rita, if you only
had one day to Iive...

615
00:41:45,078 --> 00:41:46,647
What would you do?

616
00:41:46,878 --> 00:41:49,323
I don't know.
What are you dying of?

617
00:41:49,558 --> 00:41:53,846
No, the whole world
is about to explode.

618
00:41:54,038 --> 00:41:55,004
What do you do?

619
00:41:55,238 --> 00:41:57,445
I want to know
where to put the camera.

620
00:41:57,637 --> 00:42:00,039
What are you looking for?
A date for the weekend?

621
00:42:00,277 --> 00:42:03,008
No, I'm just interested in you.

622
00:42:03,237 --> 00:42:05,400
What do you want?
What do you like?

623
00:42:05,597 --> 00:42:07,406
What do you think about?

624
00:42:07,637 --> 00:42:09,844
What kind of men
are you interested in?

625
00:42:10,037 --> 00:42:11,801
What do you do for fun?

626
00:42:12,437 --> 00:42:15,567
Are you trying to
make me look like a fool?

627
00:42:15,758 --> 00:42:19,809
I'm trying to talk like normal people.
Isn't this how they talk?

628
00:42:19,998 --> 00:42:22,239
-CIose.
-Okay, so talk to me.

629
00:42:22,479 --> 00:42:24,606
Let me buy you a cup of coffee.

630
00:42:26,798 --> 00:42:27,640
And a dough nut.

631
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:29,408
All right.

632
00:42:31,678 --> 00:42:33,601
So what do you want out of life?

633
00:42:35,438 --> 00:42:37,600
I guess I want what everybody wants.

634
00:42:37,798 --> 00:42:41,200
Career, love, marriage, children.

635
00:42:41,598 --> 00:42:43,009
Are you seeing anyone?

636
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:47,961
This is getting too personal.
I'm not ready to share this with you.

637
00:42:49,078 --> 00:42:51,239
How about you?
What do you want?

638
00:42:52,357 --> 00:42:55,520
What I really want
is someone like you.

639
00:42:55,757 --> 00:42:56,997
Oh, please!

640
00:42:57,238 --> 00:42:59,320
Why not? What are you looking for?

641
00:42:59,558 --> 00:43:00,844
Who's your perfect guy?

642
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:06,004
First of all, he's too humble
to know he's perfect.

643
00:43:07,278 --> 00:43:08,609
That's me!

644
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:12,047
He's intelligent,
supportive, funny....

645
00:43:12,279 --> 00:43:14,406
Intelligent, supportive, funny.

646
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:17,847
Me, me, me.

647
00:43:18,078 --> 00:43:20,763
He's romantic and courageous.

648
00:43:20,998 --> 00:43:22,204
Me also.

649
00:43:22,758 --> 00:43:26,205
He's got a good body but doesn't
have to look in the mirror often.

650
00:43:26,838 --> 00:43:31,480
I have a great body, and sometimes
I go months without looking.

651
00:43:33,878 --> 00:43:37,246
He's kind, sensitive and gentle.

652
00:43:37,758 --> 00:43:39,522
He's not afraid to cry.

653
00:43:39,758 --> 00:43:42,237
This is a man
we're talking about, right?

654
00:43:42,479 --> 00:43:47,246
He likes animals, children,
and he'll change poopy diapers.

655
00:43:47,479 --> 00:43:49,766
Does he have to use the word "poopy"?

656
00:43:51,239 --> 00:43:54,561
He plays an instrument,
and he loves his mother.

657
00:43:55,759 --> 00:43:58,410
I am really close on this one.

658
00:43:59,159 --> 00:44:01,810
Really, really close.

659
00:44:06,078 --> 00:44:07,603
It's Phil Connors!

660
00:44:07,799 --> 00:44:09,039
Hello.

661
00:44:09,238 --> 00:44:11,002
Thanks for watching.

662
00:44:23,399 --> 00:44:26,447
What are the chances
of getting out today?

663
00:44:26,678 --> 00:44:28,841
Van won't start.
Larry's working on it.

664
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:30,444
Wouldn't you know it?

665
00:44:30,679 --> 00:44:32,408
Can I buy you a drink?

666
00:44:34,919 --> 00:44:37,490
Jim Beam, ice, water.

667
00:44:38,279 --> 00:44:39,360
For you, miss?

668
00:44:39,799 --> 00:44:43,008
Sweet vermouth on the rocks
with a twist, please.

669
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:52,800
Van won't start.
Larry's working on it.

670
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:54,609
Wouldn't you know it?

671
00:44:54,798 --> 00:44:56,608
Can I buy you a drink?

672
00:44:59,358 --> 00:45:01,964
Sweet vermouth, rocks,
with a twist, please.

673
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:03,001
For you, miss?

674
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,804
The same.

675
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:07,203
That's my favourite drink.

676
00:45:07,439 --> 00:45:09,123
Mine too!

677
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:10,848
It makes me think of Rome.

678
00:45:11,078 --> 00:45:14,208
The way the sun hits
the buildings in the afternoon.

679
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,803
What should we drink to?

680
00:45:18,999 --> 00:45:20,843
To the groundhog!

681
00:45:21,079 --> 00:45:23,605
I always drink to world peace.

682
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,002
Can I buy you a drink?

683
00:45:36,799 --> 00:45:39,723
Sweet vermouth, rocks,
with a twist, please.

684
00:45:40,359 --> 00:45:42,008
For you, miss?

685
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:43,843
The same.

686
00:45:44,439 --> 00:45:45,850
That's my favourite drink.

687
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:47,604
Mine too!

688
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:50,922
It makes me think of Rome.

689
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:54,801
The way the sun hits
the buildings in the afternoon.

690
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,604
What should we drink to?

691
00:45:59,561 --> 00:46:02,610
I'd like to say a prayer
and drink to world peace.

692
00:46:04,481 --> 00:46:06,209
To world peace.

693
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:19,049
-This is wonderful!
-See? Didn't I tell you?

694
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:21,209
How do you know so much
about Punxsutawney?

695
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,721
I spent a lot of time here.

696
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,928
Small-town people are
more real, down-to-earth.

697
00:46:26,161 --> 00:46:28,448
-That's how I feel!
-Really?

698
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,644
-Some white chocolate?
-Yuck, don't make me sick.

699
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,007
No white chocolate.

700
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,011
There is something
so familiar about this.

701
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,242
Do you ever have déja vu?

702
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,608
Didn't you just ask me that?

703
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:47,848
People place too much
emphasis on their careers.

704
00:46:48,041 --> 00:46:51,090
I wish we could all live
in the mountains.

705
00:46:51,281 --> 00:46:54,842
That's where I see myself
in five years. How about you?

706
00:46:55,081 --> 00:46:57,812
I agree. I just like
to go with the flow.

707
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,003
See where it leads me.

708
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,005
Well, it's led you here.

709
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:07,208
It's about a million miles
from where I started in college.

710
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,808
You weren't in broadcasting
or journalism?

711
00:47:11,841 --> 00:47:15,811
Believe it or not, I studied
19th-century French poetry.

712
00:47:16,081 --> 00:47:17,605
What a waste of time!

713
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:20,644
I mean, for someone else
that'd be a total waste.

714
00:47:20,881 --> 00:47:22,849
So bold of you to choose that.

715
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:26,609
It's incredible.
You must be a very strong person.

716
00:47:28,281 --> 00:47:31,649
People place too much
emphasis on their careers.

717
00:47:31,882 --> 00:47:36,250
I wish we could all
live in the mountains.

718
00:47:36,482 --> 00:47:38,643
That's where I see myself
in five years.

719
00:47:38,841 --> 00:47:39,808
How about you?

720
00:47:40,041 --> 00:47:43,807
I agree. I like to go
with the flow, see what happens.

721
00:47:44,042 --> 00:47:46,248
Well, it's gotten you here.

722
00:47:46,761 --> 00:47:49,844
It's a million miles
from where I started in college.

723
00:47:50,081 --> 00:47:53,403
You weren't in broadcasting
or journalism or anything like that?

724
00:47:54,481 --> 00:47:58,405
Believe it or not, I studied
19th-century French poetry.

725
00:48:14,642 --> 00:48:15,881
You speak French!

726
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:24,053
I haven't done this since I was a kid.

727
00:48:24,281 --> 00:48:26,010
Me neither. It's fun!

728
00:48:26,441 --> 00:48:27,283
Clean fun.

729
00:48:30,042 --> 00:48:33,409
I hope one day I can do this
with my own children.

730
00:48:36,681 --> 00:48:38,843
Where'd you get that?

731
00:48:39,081 --> 00:48:41,607
Well, I went over
to the snowman shop.

732
00:48:43,362 --> 00:48:44,851
Hey, an assassin!

733
00:48:45,281 --> 00:48:46,806
I'll protect you!

734
00:48:47,281 --> 00:48:49,932
I shall die for you.
You shall not take her!

735
00:48:50,121 --> 00:48:51,361
Find cover!

736
00:48:53,601 --> 00:48:55,842
I'm getting some good ones.

737
00:48:56,042 --> 00:48:58,807
That's a boy! Good try.

738
00:48:59,002 --> 00:49:00,606
Help me!

739
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:55,408
What?

740
00:49:55,642 --> 00:49:59,533
I'm just amazed,
and I'm not easily amazed.

741
00:49:59,762 --> 00:50:01,127
About what?

742
00:50:01,362 --> 00:50:04,013
How you can start a day with one
kind of expectation...

743
00:50:04,202 --> 00:50:06,204
And end up
so completely different.

744
00:50:07,562 --> 00:50:10,611
Do you like the way
this day is turning out?

745
00:50:10,802 --> 00:50:13,123
I like it very much.

746
00:50:13,361 --> 00:50:16,729
It's a perfect day.
You couldn't plan a day like this.

747
00:50:16,962 --> 00:50:18,168
Well, you can.

748
00:50:18,361 --> 00:50:21,251
It just takes an awful lot of work.

749
00:50:21,482 --> 00:50:23,609
Come in.
I want to show you something.

750
00:50:23,803 --> 00:50:26,010
-I don't think I should.
-I agree.

751
00:50:26,242 --> 00:50:30,406
That's why I'll show you one thing,
then kick you right out.

752
00:50:38,242 --> 00:50:40,404
It's just lovely.

753
00:50:50,362 --> 00:50:53,013
Would you like to sit
and stare at the fake fire?

754
00:50:57,482 --> 00:50:59,610
It's a really wonderful room.

755
00:50:59,842 --> 00:51:01,606
It is now.

756
00:51:08,242 --> 00:51:10,610
I don't think we should do this.

757
00:51:10,843 --> 00:51:12,413
I don't either.

758
00:51:15,003 --> 00:51:17,608
On second thought,
I think we should.

759
00:51:18,402 --> 00:51:21,451
It's the perfect end
to a perfect day.

760
00:51:22,003 --> 00:51:24,812
Well, it's a little fast for me.

761
00:51:25,043 --> 00:51:26,408
Me too.

762
00:51:26,843 --> 00:51:29,004
Maybe I should go.

763
00:51:29,203 --> 00:51:31,046
Where would you go?

764
00:51:31,282 --> 00:51:32,614
Why?

765
00:51:32,802 --> 00:51:35,009
We've got a perfect fire.

766
00:51:35,283 --> 00:51:38,207
I've got some French poetry here.
Baudelaire....

767
00:51:39,682 --> 00:51:41,127
I will read to you.

768
00:51:41,842 --> 00:51:45,814
I've got some ice cream on
the windowsill. Hold on a minute.

769
00:51:51,202 --> 00:51:52,203
Rocky road.

770
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:53,933
I love rocky road.

771
00:51:54,164 --> 00:51:56,006
Yeah, I thought so.

772
00:51:56,283 --> 00:51:57,933
You have to stay.

773
00:51:58,163 --> 00:52:01,804
No, really, I'm tired.
We can see each other tomorrow.

774
00:52:02,043 --> 00:52:05,650
No, tonight.
It's got to be tonight.

775
00:52:05,843 --> 00:52:08,608
No, Phil, really.

776
00:52:09,483 --> 00:52:12,612
Just stay for a while and
if you like it, stay longer.

777
00:52:12,803 --> 00:52:14,851
And if you like that, stay longer.

778
00:52:15,042 --> 00:52:16,851
Let's not spoil it, okay?

779
00:52:17,083 --> 00:52:19,404
I don't want to spoil it either.

780
00:52:19,602 --> 00:52:22,413
You know I can't stay with you.

781
00:52:22,642 --> 00:52:25,612
Why not? I love you.

782
00:52:27,562 --> 00:52:29,611
You love me?

783
00:52:29,842 --> 00:52:33,814
-You don't even know me.
-I know you.

784
00:52:35,283 --> 00:52:38,127
Oh, no. I can't believe
I fell for this!

785
00:52:38,364 --> 00:52:40,651
This whole day has been
one long setup.

786
00:52:40,883 --> 00:52:41,805
No, it hasn't.

787
00:52:42,043 --> 00:52:44,694
And I hate fudge. Yuck!

788
00:52:44,963 --> 00:52:46,931
No white chocolate, no fudge.

789
00:52:47,483 --> 00:52:50,771
What are you doing?
Are you making some kind of list?

790
00:52:50,963 --> 00:52:54,046
Did you call my friends
and ask them what I like?

791
00:52:54,283 --> 00:52:57,652
-Is this what love is for you?
-This is real. This is love.

792
00:52:57,843 --> 00:52:59,254
Stop saying that!

793
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,333
You must be crazy.

794
00:53:01,563 --> 00:53:05,124
I could never love you because
you'll never love anyone but yourself.

795
00:53:05,643 --> 00:53:09,090
I don't even like myself.
Give me another chance.

796
00:53:10,683 --> 00:53:13,208
That's for making me
care about you.

797
00:53:19,883 --> 00:53:22,250
I haven't done this
since I was a kid.

798
00:53:22,484 --> 00:53:23,450
It's fun!

799
00:53:23,644 --> 00:53:27,808
And good, clean fun too.
That's what's missing in the world.

800
00:53:28,044 --> 00:53:30,649
I can't wait to do this
with my own children.

801
00:53:30,844 --> 00:53:32,334
I want lots of kids!

802
00:53:32,563 --> 00:53:36,249
I want to adopt, I want my own kids,
I want to have foster kids.

803
00:53:36,484 --> 00:53:38,645
I got this at Snowman City.

804
00:53:38,883 --> 00:53:41,614
Hey! Some kid just
threw a snowball at us.

805
00:53:41,844 --> 00:53:44,574
Come here! Let's have some fun!

806
00:53:46,684 --> 00:53:49,369
I wish these were my own kids.

807
00:53:51,883 --> 00:53:54,409
Are any of you up for adoption?

808
00:53:55,084 --> 00:53:57,404
Here's a humdinger over here!

809
00:53:57,644 --> 00:53:59,613
Wasn't that great?

810
00:54:07,685 --> 00:54:09,255
Stop it!

811
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:54,128
Phil! Over here!

812
00:54:56,405 --> 00:54:58,932
Where have you been?
You're missing the fun.

813
00:54:59,165 --> 00:55:00,974
Phil, you look terrible.

814
00:55:01,605 --> 00:55:04,006
What happened? Rough night?

815
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:23,089
Okay, campers.

816
00:55:23,485 --> 00:55:25,249
Rise and shine.

817
00:55:27,085 --> 00:55:30,612
Don't forget your booties,
because it's cold out there.

818
00:55:31,484 --> 00:55:33,805
It's cold out there every day.

819
00:55:34,285 --> 00:55:38,177
This country's largest lake,
Chapala, is located near Guadalajara.

820
00:55:39,286 --> 00:55:40,333
What is Mexico?

821
00:55:40,525 --> 00:55:41,527
What is Mexico?

822
00:55:41,846 --> 00:55:43,609
-Correct.
-Lakes and Rivers, 400.

823
00:55:43,846 --> 00:55:46,417
Seneca is the largest
of these lakes.

824
00:55:47,045 --> 00:55:48,490
What are the Finger Lakes?

825
00:55:48,686 --> 00:55:51,529
-What are the Finger Lakes?
-Correct.

826
00:55:51,726 --> 00:55:55,730
-This lake in Bolivia...
-What is Titicaca?

827
00:55:55,966 --> 00:55:57,649
-What is Titicaca?
-Correct.

828
00:55:57,846 --> 00:55:58,767
For 1000.

829
00:55:58,966 --> 00:56:00,808
-Milky-coloured-
-The Rhone.

830
00:56:01,045 --> 00:56:02,615
When entering Lake Geneva...

831
00:56:02,845 --> 00:56:05,291
This river is
clear blue upon exiting.

832
00:56:05,485 --> 00:56:06,407
-Jim?
-The Rhone.

833
00:56:06,645 --> 00:56:07,931
Good for $1000.

834
00:56:08,165 --> 00:56:10,486
You're $500 off the lead right now.

835
00:56:13,165 --> 00:56:14,769
This is pitiful.

836
00:56:15,085 --> 00:56:16,450
A thousand people...

837
00:56:16,685 --> 00:56:19,575
Freezing their butts off,
waiting to worship a rat.

838
00:56:19,765 --> 00:56:21,291
What a hype.

839
00:56:21,926 --> 00:56:25,817
They used to pull the hog out,
and they used to eat it.

840
00:56:26,006 --> 00:56:29,010
You're hypocrites! All of you!

841
00:56:31,205 --> 00:56:32,695
You got a problem, Larry?

842
00:56:34,086 --> 00:56:38,727
Untie your tongue. Come here and talk.
Am I upsetting you, princess?

843
00:56:38,926 --> 00:56:40,654
You want a prediction
about the weather?

844
00:56:40,886 --> 00:56:43,457
You're asking the wrong Phil.

845
00:56:43,685 --> 00:56:46,256
I'll give you a winter prediction.

846
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:48,454
It's going to be cold.

847
00:56:48,685 --> 00:56:50,813
It's going to be gray.

848
00:56:51,005 --> 00:56:55,614
And it's going to last you
for the rest of your life.

849
00:57:33,086 --> 00:57:36,214
To this tiny village
in Western Pennsylvania.

850
00:57:36,406 --> 00:57:39,215
There is no way that this winter...

851
00:57:39,446 --> 00:57:42,210
Is ever going to end...

852
00:57:42,406 --> 00:57:46,206
As long as this groundhog
keeps seeing his shadow.

853
00:57:46,445 --> 00:57:48,254
I don't see any other way out.

854
00:57:49,005 --> 00:57:50,816
He's got to be stopped.

855
00:57:52,247 --> 00:57:53,577
And I have to stop it.

856
00:57:56,006 --> 00:57:58,247
Real good, Phil.
Real good.

857
00:57:59,766 --> 00:58:01,291
He's out of his gourd.

858
00:58:05,766 --> 00:58:09,009
I'm worried. There's something
really wrong with Phil.

859
00:58:09,246 --> 00:58:11,817
There's a lot of things
wrong with Phil.

860
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:15,092
Hi, Phil.

861
00:58:15,486 --> 00:58:17,534
I've come to the end of me.

862
00:58:17,766 --> 00:58:19,814
There's no way out now.

863
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:24,415
Just remember, we had
a beautiful day together once.

864
00:58:27,686 --> 00:58:29,050
All right, little fellow.

865
00:58:29,286 --> 00:58:32,529
Good job. He just smiled at me!
Did you see that?

866
00:58:32,766 --> 00:58:34,211
I believe he did.

867
00:58:35,086 --> 00:58:37,817
Okay, little fellow.
There you go.

868
00:58:39,726 --> 00:58:42,014
Hi, there. Something I can
do you for?

869
00:58:44,487 --> 00:58:46,330
Hey! What are you doing?

870
00:58:50,887 --> 00:58:52,854
Get the word out.
Somebody kidnapped Phil!

871
00:58:53,206 --> 00:58:54,492
We are going after him!

872
00:59:00,886 --> 00:59:03,207
Why would anybody steal a groundhog?

873
00:59:03,646 --> 00:59:05,410
I could think of reasons.

874
00:59:05,607 --> 00:59:06,528
Pervert.

875
00:59:31,487 --> 00:59:33,216
He must have just snapped!

876
00:59:33,407 --> 00:59:34,693
This ought to be good.

877
00:59:36,967 --> 00:59:38,172
What is he doing?

878
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:39,857
What can he be thinking?

879
00:59:40,486 --> 00:59:42,011
Not bad for a quadruped.

880
00:59:42,247 --> 00:59:46,013
Check your mirrors. Side of your eye.
Side of your eye.

881
00:59:51,806 --> 00:59:53,252
That's it.

882
00:59:53,487 --> 00:59:56,410
Hey, they're chasing us!
Come on, make it fun.

883
01:00:04,287 --> 01:00:05,413
Don't drive angry.

884
01:00:05,607 --> 01:00:06,768
Don't drive angry.

885
01:00:25,967 --> 01:00:28,732
There's no way out
except the way we came in!

886
01:00:28,967 --> 01:00:30,378
We got him now!

887
01:00:48,887 --> 01:00:50,048
What is he doing?

888
01:00:50,288 --> 01:00:51,255
I don't know.

889
01:00:55,407 --> 01:00:58,093
If you got to shoot,
don't hit the groundhog.

890
01:01:02,688 --> 01:01:04,371
Mustn't keep them waiting.

891
01:01:07,567 --> 01:01:08,853
It's show time.

892
01:01:14,967 --> 01:01:16,207
On me in three...

893
01:01:18,248 --> 01:01:19,055
Two...

894
01:01:20,887 --> 01:01:21,809
One.

895
01:01:35,048 --> 01:01:36,049
Phil!

896
01:01:38,288 --> 01:01:39,619
He might be okay.

897
01:01:44,047 --> 01:01:46,494
Well, no. Probably not now.

898
01:02:01,487 --> 01:02:02,693
Nuts.

899
01:02:10,288 --> 01:02:13,098
Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?

900
01:02:14,088 --> 01:02:15,693
Would you like...

901
01:02:16,288 --> 01:02:17,654
Some toast?

902
01:02:35,249 --> 01:02:37,251
Oh, my God!

903
01:03:08,490 --> 01:03:09,820
That's him.

904
01:03:12,849 --> 01:03:16,138
He was a really, really great guy.

905
01:03:16,369 --> 01:03:18,020
I really, really liked him...

906
01:03:18,410 --> 01:03:19,410
A lot.

907
01:03:26,449 --> 01:03:28,372
I'm sorry?
What was that again?

908
01:03:28,769 --> 01:03:31,420
-I'm a god.
-You're God?

909
01:03:31,609 --> 01:03:34,738
I'm a god. I'm not the God,
I don't think.

910
01:03:35,289 --> 01:03:37,337
Because you survived a car wreck?

911
01:03:37,529 --> 01:03:38,655
You folks ready to order?

912
01:03:38,889 --> 01:03:41,972
I didn't just survive a wreck.
I wasn't just blown up.

913
01:03:42,369 --> 01:03:44,849
I have been stabbed,
shot, poisoned...

914
01:03:45,049 --> 01:03:48,259
Frozen, hung, electrocuted
and burned.

915
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:49,736
Oh, really.

916
01:03:49,970 --> 01:03:54,019
Every morning I wake up without a
scratch, not a dent in the fender.

917
01:03:54,690 --> 01:03:55,737
I am an immortal.

918
01:03:55,929 --> 01:03:58,456
Special today is blueberry waffles.

919
01:03:58,650 --> 01:04:00,413
Why are you telling me this?

920
01:04:00,690 --> 01:04:02,737
Because I want you to believe in me.

921
01:04:02,930 --> 01:04:04,215
You are not a god.

922
01:04:04,410 --> 01:04:07,697
Take my word. It's 12 years
of Catholic school talking.

923
01:04:08,210 --> 01:04:10,099
I can come back if you're not ready.

924
01:04:10,289 --> 01:04:12,212
How do you know I'm not a god?

925
01:04:12,410 --> 01:04:13,615
Please.

926
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:16,090
-How do you know?
-It's not possible.

927
01:04:16,289 --> 01:04:17,973
I'll come back.

928
01:04:18,289 --> 01:04:19,495
Doris.

929
01:04:22,769 --> 01:04:25,249
This is Doris.
Her brother-in-law owns this diner.

930
01:04:25,489 --> 01:04:29,016
She's worked here since she was 17.
She wants to see Paris...

931
01:04:29,209 --> 01:04:30,370
Before she dies.

932
01:04:30,569 --> 01:04:31,492
Boy, would I!

933
01:04:31,690 --> 01:04:34,261
-What are you doing?
-Debbie and her fiancé.

934
01:04:34,490 --> 01:04:35,696
Do I know you?

935
01:04:35,890 --> 01:04:38,655
They're supposed to get married.
She's having second thoughts.

936
01:04:38,890 --> 01:04:40,016
What?

937
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:41,331
Lovely ring.

938
01:04:41,570 --> 01:04:46,212
Bill's been a waiter three years,
since he left Penn State to work.

939
01:04:46,450 --> 01:04:49,420
He likes the town,
paints toy soldiers and he's gay.

940
01:04:49,610 --> 01:04:50,611
I am.

941
01:04:51,210 --> 01:04:53,861
Gus hates it here,
wishes he'd stayed in the Navy.

942
01:04:54,089 --> 01:04:56,536
I could've retired
on half pay after 20 years.

943
01:04:56,769 --> 01:04:58,534
Excuse me. Is this a trick?

944
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:02,455
Maybe the real God uses tricks.
Maybe he's not omnipotent...

945
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:04,533
He just knows everything.

946
01:05:04,769 --> 01:05:06,056
-Who's that?
-Tom.

947
01:05:06,289 --> 01:05:08,213
He worked in the coal mine
till it closed.

948
01:05:08,409 --> 01:05:09,535
-And her?
-Alice.

949
01:05:09,770 --> 01:05:12,215
Came from Ireland when she
was a baby. Lived in Erie.

950
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:13,258
He's right.

951
01:05:13,449 --> 01:05:14,815
-And her?
-Nancy.

952
01:05:15,050 --> 01:05:18,851
Works in a shop, makes noises like
a chipmunk when she gets excited.

953
01:05:19,090 --> 01:05:20,740
-It's true.
-How do you know this?

954
01:05:20,970 --> 01:05:22,620
I told you, I know everything.

955
01:05:22,850 --> 01:05:25,615
In five seconds, a waiter
will drop a tray.

956
01:05:25,810 --> 01:05:28,461
-Five, four, three, two, one.
-This is nuts.

957
01:05:30,691 --> 01:05:33,011
-Okay?
-Okay, that's enough.

958
01:05:34,010 --> 01:05:36,138
What about me?
Do you know me too?

959
01:05:36,370 --> 01:05:40,420
I know all about you. You hope
for more than Channel 9 Pittsburgh.

960
01:05:40,610 --> 01:05:42,931
Well, everyone knows that.

961
01:05:43,290 --> 01:05:45,770
You like boats but not the ocean.

962
01:05:46,170 --> 01:05:49,413
You go to a lake in the summer
with your family.

963
01:05:49,650 --> 01:05:53,415
There's a dock and a boathouse
with boards missing from the roof...

964
01:05:54,090 --> 01:05:56,900
And a place you used to
crawl underneath to be alone.

965
01:05:57,490 --> 01:06:00,619
You're a sucker for
French poetry and rhinestones.

966
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:02,656
You're very generous.

967
01:06:02,890 --> 01:06:05,292
You're kind to strangers
and children.

968
01:06:05,811 --> 01:06:08,541
When you stand in the snow
you look like an angel.

969
01:06:08,970 --> 01:06:10,460
How are you doing this?

970
01:06:11,491 --> 01:06:14,334
I told you. I wake up every day.

971
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:16,174
Right here.

972
01:06:16,371 --> 01:06:19,658
Right in Punxsutawney.
And it's always February 2nd.

973
01:06:20,610 --> 01:06:23,011
And there's nothing
I can do about it.

974
01:06:23,690 --> 01:06:26,660
If you still can't believe me, listen:

975
01:06:26,891 --> 01:06:28,814
In 10 seconds...

976
01:06:29,290 --> 01:06:32,613
Larry is going to come
and take you away from me.

977
01:06:32,850 --> 01:06:34,614
But you can't let him.

978
01:06:35,570 --> 01:06:38,494
Please believe me.
You've got to believe me.

979
01:06:43,370 --> 01:06:47,217
You guys ready? We better go,
to stay ahead of the weather.

980
01:06:47,811 --> 01:06:49,017
What's that?

981
01:06:49,891 --> 01:06:52,212
"... to stay ahead of the weather."

982
01:06:57,491 --> 01:07:01,415
Maybe it really is happening.
How else could you know so much?

983
01:07:01,611 --> 01:07:04,012
There is no way.
I'm not that smart.

984
01:07:05,091 --> 01:07:07,253
Maybe I should
spend the day with you...

985
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:10,813
As an objective witness,
just to see what happens.

986
01:07:11,051 --> 01:07:13,418
This sounds like a science project.

987
01:07:14,491 --> 01:07:15,652
Concentrate.

988
01:07:15,890 --> 01:07:17,620
You got to want it.

989
01:07:18,050 --> 01:07:20,052
You got to want it, Rita.

990
01:07:20,491 --> 01:07:24,211
Come on. It's more
in the wrist than the fingers.

991
01:07:32,171 --> 01:07:33,935
Be the hat. Come on, go.

992
01:07:34,172 --> 01:07:37,015
-It'd take me a year to get good.
-Six months.

993
01:07:37,252 --> 01:07:40,380
Four to five hours a day,
and you'd be an expert.

994
01:07:40,851 --> 01:07:44,333
-Is this what you do with eternity?
-Now you know.

995
01:07:45,691 --> 01:07:47,659
That's not the worst part.

996
01:07:47,891 --> 01:07:49,256
What's the worst part?

997
01:07:49,491 --> 01:07:51,414
The worst part is that...

998
01:07:51,611 --> 01:07:54,057
Tomorrow you'll have
forgotten all about this...

999
01:07:54,290 --> 01:07:56,419
And you'll treat me
like a jerk again.

1000
01:07:57,491 --> 01:07:58,902
I am a jerk.

1001
01:07:59,091 --> 01:08:00,855
No, you're not.

1002
01:08:01,211 --> 01:08:05,535
It doesn't make any difference.
I've killed myself so many times...

1003
01:08:05,771 --> 01:08:07,421
I don't even exist anymore.

1004
01:08:07,970 --> 01:08:10,621
Sometimes I wish I had
a thousand lifetimes.

1005
01:08:11,171 --> 01:08:14,060
I don't know.
Maybe it's not a curse.

1006
01:08:14,291 --> 01:08:16,818
It just depends
on how you look at it.

1007
01:08:18,292 --> 01:08:20,419
Gosh, you're an upbeat lady!

1008
01:08:23,571 --> 01:08:26,620
I want you to know it's been
a really nice day for me.

1009
01:08:26,851 --> 01:08:27,693
Me too.

1010
01:08:27,892 --> 01:08:29,052
And maybe...

1011
01:08:29,292 --> 01:08:32,818
If it's not too boring,
we can do it again sometime.

1012
01:08:33,051 --> 01:08:34,416
I hope so.

1013
01:08:46,091 --> 01:08:47,820
You're still here?

1014
01:08:50,091 --> 01:08:52,822
I thought you were supposed
to disappear. Or I was.

1015
01:08:53,051 --> 01:08:54,655
Not until 6.

1016
01:08:55,490 --> 01:08:56,856
You rat!

1017
01:08:57,091 --> 01:08:58,855
I never said midnight.

1018
01:08:59,172 --> 01:09:01,538
You knew I was waiting for midnight.

1019
01:09:02,291 --> 01:09:03,657
Are you going to leave?

1020
01:09:05,412 --> 01:09:06,652
No.

1021
01:09:07,291 --> 01:09:08,372
Good.

1022
01:09:18,611 --> 01:09:20,215
I'm sorry.

1023
01:09:21,651 --> 01:09:23,814
It's all right.
You can fall asleep.

1024
01:09:24,771 --> 01:09:27,012
I promise I won't touch you.

1025
01:09:27,691 --> 01:09:28,897
Much.

1026
01:09:30,172 --> 01:09:32,823
It's all right. I'm not tired.

1027
01:09:33,612 --> 01:09:35,215
What were you saying?

1028
01:09:36,572 --> 01:09:39,734
I think the last thing
that you heard was:

1029
01:09:39,971 --> 01:09:42,542
"Only God could make a tree."

1030
01:09:42,771 --> 01:09:43,820
Really?

1031
01:10:20,413 --> 01:10:22,620
What I wanted to say was...

1032
01:10:24,292 --> 01:10:26,340
I think you are the kindest...

1033
01:10:26,572 --> 01:10:29,020
Sweetest, prettiest person...

1034
01:10:29,494 --> 01:10:31,417
I've ever met in my life.

1035
01:10:32,894 --> 01:10:35,021
I've never seen anyone...

1036
01:10:35,614 --> 01:10:38,014
That's nicer to people
than you are.

1037
01:10:50,453 --> 01:10:52,421
And the first time I saw you...

1038
01:10:53,453 --> 01:10:55,615
Something happened to me.

1039
01:10:56,813 --> 01:10:58,861
I never told you...

1040
01:11:02,093 --> 01:11:04,414
But I knew I wanted
to hold you...

1041
01:11:04,613 --> 01:11:06,422
As hard as I could.

1042
01:11:18,854 --> 01:11:21,221
I don't deserve someone like you.

1043
01:11:24,893 --> 01:11:26,623
But if I ever could...

1044
01:11:28,014 --> 01:11:30,016
I swear I would love you...

1045
01:11:30,374 --> 01:11:32,421
For the rest of my life.

1046
01:11:36,814 --> 01:11:38,623
Did you say something?

1047
01:11:44,093 --> 01:11:45,618
Good night, Rita.

1048
01:11:46,773 --> 01:11:48,298
Good night, Phil.

1049
01:12:12,214 --> 01:12:15,422
Campers, rise and shine!
Don't forget your booties.

1050
01:12:15,614 --> 01:12:18,538
-It's cold out there!
-It's cold every day.

1051
01:12:18,734 --> 01:12:20,941
-Is this Miami Beach?
-Not hardly!

1052
01:12:54,894 --> 01:12:57,261
Who wants coffee?
Get it while it's hot.

1053
01:12:58,094 --> 01:12:59,220
Thanks, Phil.

1054
01:12:59,414 --> 01:13:00,222
Larry?

1055
01:13:00,454 --> 01:13:02,456
Skim milk, two sugar.

1056
01:13:02,694 --> 01:13:03,980
Thanks, Phil.

1057
01:13:04,174 --> 01:13:05,300
Pastry?

1058
01:13:05,534 --> 01:13:06,660
We're setting up.

1059
01:13:06,854 --> 01:13:08,583
Pastry, Larry?
Take your pick.

1060
01:13:09,773 --> 01:13:11,742
Thanks. Raspberry. Great.

1061
01:13:12,214 --> 01:13:15,263
I talked with Buster Green,
the head groundhog honcho.

1062
01:13:15,493 --> 01:13:18,179
He said if we set up here
we'll get a better shot.

1063
01:13:18,614 --> 01:13:20,775
-What do you think?
-Sounds good.

1064
01:13:21,094 --> 01:13:22,254
Larry?

1065
01:13:23,494 --> 01:13:25,336
Yeah. Let's go for it.

1066
01:13:25,574 --> 01:13:26,575
Good work, Phil.

1067
01:13:27,214 --> 01:13:30,424
Maybe we'll get lucky.
Let me give you a hand.

1068
01:13:31,814 --> 01:13:34,625
No, no. You got your coffee.
I'll get it.

1069
01:13:35,854 --> 01:13:37,664
We never talk.
Do you have kids?

1070
01:14:11,014 --> 01:14:12,779
I'd like a piano lesson.

1071
01:14:13,095 --> 01:14:16,895
I'm with a student. But if you
want to come back tomorrow...

1072
01:14:17,095 --> 01:14:20,224
I kind of want to get started.
I can give you $1000.

1073
01:14:22,855 --> 01:14:23,742
Come on in.

1074
01:14:42,494 --> 01:14:44,463
Morning!
Off to see the groundhog?

1075
01:14:44,654 --> 01:14:46,622
Buon giorno, signore!

1076
01:14:47,575 --> 01:14:49,941
Think it'll be an early spring?

1077
01:14:50,175 --> 01:14:52,462
Winter, slumbering in the open air

1078
01:14:52,694 --> 01:14:54,264
Wears on his smiling face...

1079
01:14:54,494 --> 01:14:56,624
A dream of spring

1080
01:14:56,855 --> 01:14:57,856
Ciao!

1081
01:14:59,095 --> 01:15:00,256
Ciao!

1082
01:15:36,814 --> 01:15:38,020
How does she look?

1083
01:15:38,294 --> 01:15:39,342
Great.

1084
01:15:39,814 --> 01:15:40,702
Thank you.

1085
01:15:40,896 --> 01:15:44,218
-Did you know he could ice sculpt?
-No.

1086
01:15:57,695 --> 01:16:00,778
Not bad. You say
this is your first lesson?

1087
01:16:01,695 --> 01:16:04,824
Yes, but my father
was a piano mover, so....

1088
01:16:10,495 --> 01:16:14,819
-Phil Connors, I thought it was you.
-Ned Ryerson.

1089
01:16:16,455 --> 01:16:18,901
I have missed you so much.

1090
01:16:23,095 --> 01:16:26,498
I don't know where you're headed,
but can you call in sick?

1091
01:16:29,776 --> 01:16:31,618
I got to get going.

1092
01:16:32,456 --> 01:16:34,424
It's good to see you, Phil.

1093
01:16:53,895 --> 01:16:55,545
Let's get you someplace warm.

1094
01:16:57,295 --> 01:16:58,626
Remember me?

1095
01:17:05,175 --> 01:17:06,825
You brought the old man in?

1096
01:17:07,016 --> 01:17:08,016
How is he?

1097
01:17:08,695 --> 01:17:10,619
He just passed away.

1098
01:17:12,296 --> 01:17:15,220
-What did he die of?
-He was just old.

1099
01:17:15,456 --> 01:17:17,220
It was just his time.

1100
01:17:19,856 --> 01:17:22,746
-I want to see his chart. Excuse me.
-Sir!

1101
01:17:23,096 --> 01:17:24,666
You can't come in here.

1102
01:17:24,896 --> 01:17:27,422
Sir, this is a restricted area.

1103
01:17:36,215 --> 01:17:37,820
Where's the chart?

1104
01:17:38,296 --> 01:17:40,537
Sometimes people just die.

1105
01:17:41,416 --> 01:17:42,827
Not today.

1106
01:17:54,696 --> 01:17:56,825
Gets hard down there at the bottom.

1107
01:17:59,616 --> 01:18:00,777
Here you go.

1108
01:18:01,096 --> 01:18:02,178
Thank you.

1109
01:18:06,416 --> 01:18:07,464
Come on, dad.

1110
01:18:07,696 --> 01:18:09,027
Come on, pop.

1111
01:18:10,897 --> 01:18:12,625
Come on. Come on, breathe.

1112
01:18:12,856 --> 01:18:15,428
Breathe, pop! Breathe, pop!

1113
01:18:40,097 --> 01:18:42,668
When Chekhov saw the long winter...

1114
01:18:43,097 --> 01:18:46,341
He saw a winter bleak
and dark and bereft of hope.

1115
01:18:46,577 --> 01:18:51,060
Yet we know winter is just
another step in the cycle of life.

1116
01:18:51,298 --> 01:18:54,824
But standing here among
the people of Punxsutawney...

1117
01:18:55,058 --> 01:18:57,743
And basking in the warmth
of their hearths and hearts...

1118
01:18:58,778 --> 01:19:00,984
I couldn't imagine a better fate...

1119
01:19:01,177 --> 01:19:04,021
Than along and lustrous winter.

1120
01:19:04,257 --> 01:19:06,942
From Punxsutawney, it's Phil Connors.

1121
01:19:07,178 --> 01:19:08,417
So long.

1122
01:19:10,218 --> 01:19:11,867
Nice speech. Very nice.

1123
01:19:12,098 --> 01:19:13,224
Thank you.

1124
01:19:14,497 --> 01:19:17,626
-How was that for you two?
-My man, you touched me.

1125
01:19:17,857 --> 01:19:19,461
-Thanks, Larry.
-Thank you.

1126
01:19:20,777 --> 01:19:21,664
I got to go.

1127
01:19:23,177 --> 01:19:27,069
That was surprising.
I didn't know you were so versatile.

1128
01:19:27,298 --> 01:19:28,902
I surprise myself sometimes.

1129
01:19:29,098 --> 01:19:31,020
Would you like a cup of coffee?

1130
01:19:31,218 --> 01:19:35,018
I'd love to. Can I have a rain check?
I've got some errands.

1131
01:19:38,617 --> 01:19:40,461
Errands? What errands?

1132
01:19:59,737 --> 01:20:02,468
What do you say?
What do you say?

1133
01:20:02,658 --> 01:20:05,422
You little brat.
You have never thanked me!

1134
01:20:06,098 --> 01:20:07,667
I'll see you tomorrow...

1135
01:20:07,897 --> 01:20:08,945
Maybe.

1136
01:20:16,339 --> 01:20:18,580
You totaled it.

1137
01:20:18,778 --> 01:20:22,749
-It's only a flat tire.
-What are we going to do?

1138
01:20:24,058 --> 01:20:27,346
-It's an earthquake!
-It's not an earthquake.

1139
01:20:27,538 --> 01:20:28,505
What is it?

1140
01:20:31,938 --> 01:20:33,940
Thank you, young man.

1141
01:20:35,018 --> 01:20:37,305
It's nothing.
I had the tire and the jack.

1142
01:20:37,537 --> 01:20:40,064
Just be comfortable.
It'll be a minute.

1143
01:20:40,298 --> 01:20:41,459
Who is that?

1144
01:20:41,697 --> 01:20:44,348
He must be from the motor club.

1145
01:20:45,537 --> 01:20:48,108
He's having a heart attack!
Do something!

1146
01:20:48,338 --> 01:20:52,262
Call 411, an ambulance, a lawyer,
doctor, anything!

1147
01:20:59,218 --> 01:21:00,708
I think that did it.

1148
01:21:04,418 --> 01:21:07,183
If you're going to eat steak,
get sharper teeth.

1149
01:21:07,418 --> 01:21:09,659
-Enjoy your meal.
-Thank you.

1150
01:21:10,218 --> 01:21:11,505
Who was that?

1151
01:21:11,698 --> 01:21:14,304
-I'm fine, I'm fine.
-Are you sure?

1152
01:21:14,539 --> 01:21:15,380
Eat, eat!

1153
01:21:19,618 --> 01:21:21,108
People don't understand...

1154
01:21:21,299 --> 01:21:23,984
What's involved.
This is an art form.

1155
01:21:24,218 --> 01:21:26,585
I think most people just think...

1156
01:21:26,818 --> 01:21:29,867
That I hold a camera
and point it at stuff.

1157
01:21:30,098 --> 01:21:32,304
There's a lot more to it than that.

1158
01:21:34,258 --> 01:21:37,626
Would you be interested in seeing
the inside of a van?

1159
01:21:37,819 --> 01:21:40,982
You know, I really have to
get back to the party.

1160
01:21:41,219 --> 01:21:42,869
Great idea.
I'll go with you.

1161
01:21:43,099 --> 01:21:45,261
Let me just drop a tip here.

1162
01:21:51,059 --> 01:21:52,504
Hi! How are you?

1163
01:21:52,738 --> 01:21:54,468
Rita, this is Nancy.

1164
01:21:55,539 --> 01:21:57,700
We were going to the party.
You going?

1165
01:21:57,899 --> 01:22:00,424
Sounds like fun.
Maybe we should call Phil.

1166
01:22:01,458 --> 01:22:03,460
I think he's already in there.

1167
01:23:55,380 --> 01:23:56,586
Isn't he good?

1168
01:23:56,820 --> 01:23:57,901
He's great!

1169
01:23:58,140 --> 01:23:59,709
He's my student.

1170
01:24:02,220 --> 01:24:04,029
I'm so proud.

1171
01:24:05,140 --> 01:24:06,301
Thank you.

1172
01:24:07,420 --> 01:24:09,388
Hello, welcome to our party.

1173
01:24:09,619 --> 01:24:11,781
I didn't know you could
play like that.

1174
01:24:12,020 --> 01:24:13,669
I'm versatile.

1175
01:24:20,740 --> 01:24:23,663
It's that nice young man
from the motor club.

1176
01:24:23,859 --> 01:24:25,305
Thank you again.

1177
01:24:25,539 --> 01:24:26,904
It's nothing, ladies.

1178
01:24:27,139 --> 01:24:30,268
He's the fastest jack
in Jefferson County.

1179
01:24:32,619 --> 01:24:34,189
What was that all about?

1180
01:24:34,420 --> 01:24:37,390
Don't know. They've been
hitting on me all night.

1181
01:24:38,220 --> 01:24:39,551
There you are!

1182
01:24:41,420 --> 01:24:44,503
I never thanked you properly
for what you did.

1183
01:24:44,740 --> 01:24:46,708
He would've choked for sure.

1184
01:24:46,940 --> 01:24:50,501
He may have. He was trying
to swallow a whole cow.

1185
01:24:50,740 --> 01:24:51,901
I owe you one, buddy.

1186
01:24:52,140 --> 01:24:55,144
Hang on to him, dear.
He's a real find.

1187
01:24:57,460 --> 01:24:59,110
What did you do today?

1188
01:24:59,340 --> 01:25:00,865
Same old, same old.

1189
01:25:06,380 --> 01:25:07,870
Excuse me, Mr. Connors.

1190
01:25:08,059 --> 01:25:09,584
Fred, how was the wedding?

1191
01:25:09,820 --> 01:25:12,709
Thank you for making
Debbie go through with it.

1192
01:25:12,940 --> 01:25:15,864
All I did was fan her flame
of passion for you.

1193
01:25:16,099 --> 01:25:17,260
You are the best.

1194
01:25:17,499 --> 01:25:18,501
No, you are.

1195
01:25:18,739 --> 01:25:21,789
Rita, this is
Debbie and Fred Kleiser.

1196
01:25:22,021 --> 01:25:25,707
-Here you go, kids. Congratulations.
-What is this?

1197
01:25:26,141 --> 01:25:27,904
No way!

1198
01:25:28,140 --> 01:25:31,144
Wrestle Mania!
No way!

1199
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:34,904
How'd you know?
We'll be in Pittsburgh anyway!

1200
01:25:35,140 --> 01:25:36,904
Thank you. You're areal pal.

1201
01:25:37,141 --> 01:25:38,949
Oh, this is the best.

1202
01:25:43,540 --> 01:25:44,905
I don't understand.

1203
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:46,790
I guess not.

1204
01:25:47,260 --> 01:25:49,911
How does everyone know you?
You come once a year.

1205
01:25:50,140 --> 01:25:51,903
You're the most popular
person in town.

1206
01:25:52,140 --> 01:25:54,268
Excuse me, Dr. Connors?

1207
01:25:54,460 --> 01:25:57,270
I want to thank you
for fixing Felix's back.

1208
01:25:57,460 --> 01:25:59,461
He can help around the house again.

1209
01:25:59,660 --> 01:26:02,061
Well, I'm sorry
to hear that, Felix.

1210
01:26:04,340 --> 01:26:05,910
Dr. Connors?

1211
01:26:06,260 --> 01:26:08,502
It's kind of an honorary title.

1212
01:26:08,741 --> 01:26:10,266
What is going on?

1213
01:26:10,460 --> 01:26:11,462
I really don't know.

1214
01:26:11,701 --> 01:26:14,068
There is something
going on with you.

1215
01:26:14,620 --> 01:26:16,509
You want the long or short version?

1216
01:26:16,741 --> 01:26:19,471
Let's start with the short
and go from there.

1217
01:26:25,021 --> 01:26:26,944
Okay, folks, attention.

1218
01:26:27,701 --> 01:26:30,705
Time for the bachelor auction.
You know the rules.

1219
01:26:30,940 --> 01:26:33,307
All the eligible bachelors
come in front.

1220
01:26:33,580 --> 01:26:34,991
And you ladies...

1221
01:26:35,220 --> 01:26:36,507
You bid on them!

1222
01:26:36,741 --> 01:26:38,710
Do whatever you want with them...

1223
01:26:38,941 --> 01:26:40,466
No questions asked!

1224
01:26:40,701 --> 01:26:43,671
I don't want to know about it,
as long as it's legal.

1225
01:26:43,741 --> 01:26:48,065
Get out your pocketbooks,

Do I hear a buck and a half?

01:28:13,462 --> 01:28:14,668
Anybody?

I got him!

1256
01:28:30,903 --> 01:28:33,509
Phil Connors,
I thought that was you.

1257
01:28:33,742 --> 01:28:36,109
This is Ned Ryerson,
my new insurance agent.

1258
01:28:36,342 --> 01:28:37,548
I'll say.

1259
01:28:38,702 --> 01:28:40,591
I haven't seen him for 20 years.

1260
01:28:40,822 --> 01:28:45,670
He comes up and buys whole life,
term, fire, auto, dental, health...

1261
01:28:45,862 --> 01:28:48,672
With the optional death
and dismemberment plan.

1262
01:28:48,902 --> 01:28:50,984
This is the best day of my life.

1263
01:28:51,222 --> 01:28:53,270
-Mine too.
-Mine too.

1264
01:28:53,462 --> 01:28:54,668
Where are we going?

1265
01:28:54,902 --> 01:28:56,552
Let's not spoil it.

1266
01:28:58,022 --> 01:29:00,548
Let's not...
I got that.

1267
01:29:03,342 --> 01:29:04,708
Why can't I look?

1268
01:29:05,143 --> 01:29:06,906
Because you bother me a lot.

1269
01:29:07,183 --> 01:29:08,514
I'm getting cold.

1270
01:29:08,703 --> 01:29:10,272
How long do I have to sit here?

1271
01:29:10,863 --> 01:29:13,867
I'm giving you your money's worth.
You paid top dollar for me.

1272
01:29:14,422 --> 01:29:16,664
Well, I think you were a bargain.

1273
01:29:17,462 --> 01:29:19,511
Sweet of you to say.
You're right.

1274
01:29:22,143 --> 01:29:23,507
Is it finished yet?

1275
01:29:24,342 --> 01:29:27,108
I still have to put
cherry syrup on the top...

1276
01:29:27,302 --> 01:29:28,304
Then we can eat it.

1277
01:29:28,542 --> 01:29:31,113
Come on, Phil.
I'm freezing!

1278
01:29:31,303 --> 01:29:32,907
One second, one second.

1279
01:29:33,142 --> 01:29:34,871
Let me turn it in the light.

1280
01:29:40,142 --> 01:29:41,588
It's amazing.

1281
01:29:42,303 --> 01:29:43,508
It's beautiful.

1282
01:29:47,623 --> 01:29:48,954
How did you do that?

1283
01:29:49,743 --> 01:29:53,384
I know your face so well,
I could do it with my eyes closed.

1284
01:29:57,743 --> 01:29:59,108
It's lovely.

1285
01:29:59,823 --> 01:30:01,587
I don't know what to say.

1286
01:30:02,743 --> 01:30:03,903
I do.

1287
01:30:05,903 --> 01:30:08,109
No matter what happens tomorrow...

1288
01:30:08,343 --> 01:30:10,152
Or for the rest of my life...

1289
01:30:10,342 --> 01:30:11,993
I'm happy now...

1290
01:30:13,143 --> 01:30:14,668
Because I love you.

1291
01:30:15,543 --> 01:30:17,272
I think I'm happy too.

1292
01:31:13,543 --> 01:31:14,669
Please. Not again.

1293
01:31:14,863 --> 01:31:16,672
-That's a great song.
-It's not.

1294
01:31:16,902 --> 01:31:18,872
Don't listen to this man...

1295
01:31:19,424 --> 01:31:21,744
It's too early.

1296
01:31:32,023 --> 01:31:33,753
Something is different.

1297
01:31:34,343 --> 01:31:35,550
Good or bad?

1298
01:31:35,903 --> 01:31:38,110
Anything different is good.

1299
01:31:40,463 --> 01:31:42,670
But this could be real good.

1300
01:31:47,344 --> 01:31:48,708
Why are you here?

1301
01:31:49,143 --> 01:31:51,146
I bought you.
I own you.

1302
01:31:53,543 --> 01:31:55,068
But why are you still here?

1303
01:31:55,303 --> 01:31:58,273
You said, "Stay," so I stayed.

1304
01:32:00,823 --> 01:32:02,792
I said, "Stay," so you stayed.

1305
01:32:03,024 --> 01:32:05,470
I can't even make a collie stay.

1306
01:32:07,544 --> 01:32:09,467
I got to check something.

1307
01:32:10,224 --> 01:32:11,555
Stay.

1308
01:32:11,944 --> 01:32:13,025
Stay.

1309
01:32:18,423 --> 01:32:19,664
They're gone!

1310
01:32:20,544 --> 01:32:22,069
They're all gone.

1311
01:32:24,064 --> 01:32:26,670
-Do you know what today is?
-No, what?

1312
01:32:27,943 --> 01:32:29,866
Today is tomorrow.

1313
01:32:30,424 --> 01:32:31,709
It happened.

1314
01:32:33,864 --> 01:32:36,026
-You're here.
-I'm here.

1315
01:32:40,023 --> 01:32:44,473
Why weren't you like this last night?
You just fell asleep.

1316
01:32:46,223 --> 01:32:48,909
It was the end of a very long day.

1317
01:32:51,864 --> 01:32:55,505
Is there anything I can do
for you today?

1318
01:32:56,344 --> 01:32:58,870
I'm sure I can think of something.

1319
01:33:30,623 --> 01:33:32,547
It's so beautiful!

1320
01:33:42,744 --> 01:33:44,314
Let's live here.

1321
01:33:54,345 --> 01:33:56,312
We'll rent to start.

1322
