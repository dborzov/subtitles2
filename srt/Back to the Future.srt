is going to pay
for the damage?

It's your car.

should pay for it.

865
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:37,880
I'm sure that in 1985,

866
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:40,132
plutonium is available
in every corner drugstore,

867
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:42,968
but in 1955,
it's a little hard
to come by.

Marty, I'm sorry,
but I'm afraid
you're stuck here.

Whoa, whoa.

870
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:52,144
Doc, stuck here?
I can't be stuck here.
I got a life in 1985.

871
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:53,312
I got a girl.

872
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:54,438
ls she pretty?

873
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:58,943
Doc, she's beautiful.
She's crazy about me.

874
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:03,322
Look at this. Look
what she wrote here, Doc.
I mean, that says it all.

875
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:07,159
Doc, you're my only hope.

876
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:11,163
Marty, I'm sorry,
but the only power source
capable of generating

1.21 gigawatts
of electricity
is a bolt of lightning.

879
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,254
A bolt of lightning.

880
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:19,338

you never know

ever going to strike.

This is it!
This is the answer.

lt says here that
a bolt of lightning

885
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:38,357
is going to
strike the clock tower

at precisely 10:04 p.m.
next Saturday night!

887
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,701
lf we could somehow
harness this lightning,

888
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:53,122
channel it into
the flux capacitor,

889
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:56,208
it just might work.

we're sending you
back to the future!

You can show me around.

out of the question.

leave this house.

with anybody else today,

bumped into my parents.

Hi.
Hi.

1220
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:49,721
Marty, this may
seem a little forward,

1221
01:11:50,097 --> 01:11:54,309
but I was
kind of wondering
if you'd ask me

1222
01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:58,229
to the Enchantment
Under the Sea dance
on Saturday.

1223
01:12:00,899 --> 01:12:04,110
Wow, you mean. . .
You mean nobody's
asked you?

1224
01:12:04,778 --> 01:12:07,864
No. Not yet.

1225
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:11,117
What about George?

1226
01:12:11,201 --> 01:12:12,994
George McFly?

1227
01:12:15,539 --> 01:12:19,542
He's kind of cute
and all, but not. . .

1228
01:12:20,419 --> 01:12:24,547
Well, I think
a man should be strong,

1229
01:12:26,467 --> 01:12:28,718
so he can stand up
for himself

1230
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:32,013
and protect
the woman he loves.

1232
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:40,688
Yeah.

01:12:41,148 --> 01:12:43,149
I still
don't understand.

1234
01:12:43,609 --> 01:12:46,319
How am I supposed to
go to the dance with her

1235
01:12:46,403 --> 01:12:49,155
if she's already going
to the dance with you?

1236
01:12:49,239 --> 01:12:51,908
Well, because, George,
she wants to go with you.

1237
01:12:51,992 --> 01:12:53,910
She just doesn't
know it yet.

1238
01:12:53,994 --> 01:12:54,994
That's why
we got to show her

1239
01:12:55,079 --> 01:12:57,038
that you, George McFly,
are a fighter.

1240
01:12:57,122 --> 01:12:59,040
You're somebody
who's gonna stand up
for yourself,

1241
01:12:59,124 --> 01:13:00,583
somebody who's
gonna protect her.

1242
01:13:00,667 --> 01:13:03,878
Yeah, but I've never
picked a fight
in my entire life.

Look, you're not going
to be picking a fight,

1245
01:13:09,093 --> 01:13:11,386
You're coming to
her rescue, right?

1246
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:12,637
Okay, let's go over
the plan again.

1247
01:13:12,721 --> 01:13:14,472
8:55, where are
you going to be?

1248
01:13:14,556 --> 01:13:16,140
I'm going to be
at the dance.

1249
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:17,266
Right. And where
am I going to be?

1250
01:13:17,351 --> 01:13:19,352
You're gonna be
in the car with her.

1251
01:13:19,436 --> 01:13:20,895
Right, okay.
So, right around 9:00,

1252
01:13:20,979 --> 01:13:22,397
she's going to get
very angry with me.

1253

Why is she going to
get angry with you?

1254
01:13:24,983 --> 01:13:27,318
Well, because, George,
nice girls get angry

1255
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:29,654
when guys take
advantage of them.

I ought to swear?

01:48:34,716 --> 01:48:36,091
Aren't you going up
to the lake tonight?

1722
01:48:36,176 --> 01:48:38,844
You've been planning it
for two weeks.

1723
01:48:38,929 --> 01:48:41,597
Mom, we talked about this.
How can I go to the lake?

1724
01:48:41,681 --> 01:48:42,806
The car's wrecked.

1725
01:48:42,891 --> 01:48:44,475
Wrecked?
Wrecked?

1726
01:48:44,559 --> 01:48:45,684
When did this happen?
Why wasn't I told?

1727
01:48:45,769 --> 01:48:46,769
Quiet down.

1728
01:48:46,853 --> 01:48:48,354
I'm sure the car is fine.

1729
01:48:48,438 --> 01:48:50,689
DAVID: Why am I always
the last one to know
about these things?

1730
01:48:50,774 --> 01:48:53,859
See? There's Biff
out there waxing
it right now.

1731
01:48:54,277 --> 01:48:55,694
Now, Biff, I want
to make sure that

1732
01:48:55,779 --> 01:48:58,614
we get two coats
of wax this time,
not just one.

1733
01:48:58,698 --> 01:49:00,282
I'm just finishing up
the second coat now.

1734
01:49:00,367 --> 01:49:02,952
Now, Biff,
don't con me.

1735
01:49:04,454 --> 01:49:06,497
I'm sorry, Mr. McFly.

1736
01:49:06,581 --> 01:49:09,667
I meant
I was just starting
on the second coat.

1737
01:49:10,752 --> 01:49:14,588
Biff. What a character.
Always trying to get
away with something.

1738
01:49:15,090 --> 01:49:18,050
I've had to stay
on top of Biff ever
since high school.

if it wasn't for him. . .

1740

have fallen in love.

1741
01:49:21,972 --> 01:49:23,430
That's right.

1742
01:49:23,974 --> 01:49:26,684
Mr. McFly! Mr. McFly,
this just arrived.

1743
01:49:26,768 --> 01:49:29,562
Oh, hi, Marty.
I think it's your
new book.

1744
01:49:32,148 --> 01:49:35,985
Honey!
Your first novel.

always told you,

1746
01:49:37,195 --> 01:49:40,114
you put your mind to it,
you can accomplish anything.

1747
01:49:40,198 --> 01:49:42,700
Oh, Marty,
here's your keys.

1748
01:49:42,784 --> 01:49:44,577
You're all waxed up,
ready for tonight.

1749
01:49:45,161 --> 01:49:46,328

Oh, are you a sight
for sore eyes!
Let me look at you.

1753
01:50:11,354 --> 01:50:14,231
Marty, you're acting
like you haven't
seen me in a week.

1754
01:50:14,316 --> 01:50:15,733
I haven't.

1755
01:50:16,318 --> 01:50:19,570
You okay?
ls everything all right?

1756
01:50:22,866 --> 01:50:23,991

You've got to come
back with me!

Where?

Back to the future.

1763
01:50:54,356 --> 01:50:56,482
Wait a minute.
What are you doing, Doc?

1764
01:50:57,484 --> 01:50:58,567
I need fuel.

1765
01:51:02,030 --> 01:51:04,448
Go ahead. Quick!
Get in the car.

1766
01:51:04,532 --> 01:51:06,575
No, no. Doc,
I just got here, okay?

1767
01:51:06,660 --> 01:51:08,661
Jennifer's here.
We're gonna take
the new truck for a spin.

1768
01:51:08,745 --> 01:51:11,997
Well, bring her along.
This concerns her, too.

1769
01:51:12,082 --> 01:51:13,666
Wait a minute, Doc.
What are you
talking about?

1770
01:51:13,750 --> 01:51:15,793
What happens to us
in the future?

1771

or something?

no, Marty.

turn out fine.
