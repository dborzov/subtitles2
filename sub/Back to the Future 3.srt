which vanished in a flash of light...

I assumed Marty and the time vehicle...

Perhaps the gigawatt discharge

a disruption of my own brain waves...

00:13:30,807 --> 00:13:35,517
"Died September 7, 1885."
That's one week after you wrote the letter!

168
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:38,758
"Erected in eternal memory
by his beloved Clara."

169
00:13:39,127 --> 00:13:40,242
Who the hell is Clara?

170
00:13:40,327 --> 00:13:44,002
- Please don't stand there!
- Right. Sorry.

171
00:13:44,087 --> 00:13:45,884
I have to get another picture.

172
00:13:47,207 --> 00:13:51,598
D0C: "Shot in the back by Buford Tannen
over a matter of $80"?

173
00:13:51,687 --> 00:13:53,803
What kind of a future do you call that?

174
00:13:54,887 --> 00:13:57,242
MARTY:
"Buford Tannen was a notorious gunman...

175
00:13:57,407 --> 00:14:00,046
<i>"...whose short temper and a tendency to drool...</i>

176
00:14:00,127 --> 00:14:01,958
<i>"...earned him the nickname 'Mad Dog.'</i>

177
00:14:02,047 --> 00:14:05,164
"He was quick on the trigger
and bragged he had killed 12 men...

178
00:14:05,247 --> 00:14:07,238
"...not including Indians or Chinamen."

179
00:14:07,327 --> 00:14:09,966
D0C: Does it name me? Am I one of the 12?
MARTY: Wait.

180
00:14:10,047 --> 00:14:13,437
"This claim cannot be proven
since precise records were not kept...

181
00:14:13,527 --> 00:14:15,358
<i>"...after Tannen shot a newspaper editor...</i>

182
00:14:15,447 --> 00:14:17,836
<i>"...who printed an unfavorable story</i>
<i>about him in 1884."</i>

183
00:14:17,927 --> 00:14:20,236
MARTY: That's why we can't find anything.
D0C: Look.

184
00:14:21,567 --> 00:14:24,320
D0C: William McFly and family.
Your relatives?

185
00:14:24,487 --> 00:14:29,402
MARTY: My great-grandfather's name
was William. That's him. Good-Iooking guy.

186
00:14:31,207 --> 00:14:33,198
D0C: McFlys, but no Browns.

187
00:14:33,287 --> 00:14:35,755
Maybe it was a mistake.
Maybe that grave wasn't yours.

188
00:14:35,847 --> 00:14:38,042
There could've been
another Emmett Brown in 1885.

189
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,118
Did you have any relatives here back then?

190
00:14:40,207 --> 00:14:44,120
The Browns didn't come to Hill Valley
until 1908. Then they were the von Brauns.

191
00:14:44,207 --> 00:14:46,596
<i>My father changed our name</i>
<i>during World War I.</i>

192
00:14:46,687 --> 00:14:47,597

[Doc gasps]

194
00:14:49,687 --> 00:14:51,882
Great Scott, it's me!

195
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,837
<i>Then it is true, all of it.</i>

196
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:58,405
<i>It is me who goes back there and gets shot.</i>

197
00:14:59,007 --> 00:15:00,679
It's not gonna happen, Doc.

198
00:15:01,087 --> 00:15:04,443
After you fix the time circuits
and put new tires on the DeLorean...

199
00:15:04,527 --> 00:15:07,803
...I'm going back to 1885,
and I'm bringing you home.

200
00:15:18,847 --> 00:15:20,439
D0C: The clothes fit?

201
00:15:20,727 --> 00:15:24,003
MARTY: Everything except the boots.
They're kind of tight.

202
00:15:24,167 --> 00:15:26,362
<i>Are you sure this stuff is authentic?</i>

203
00:15:26,447 --> 00:15:29,280
0f course.
Haven't you ever seen a Western?

204
00:15:30,487 --> 00:15:32,125
Yeah, I have.

205
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:35,280
Clint Eastwood never wore anything like this.

206
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:40,082
- Clint who?
- Right. You haven't heard of him yet.

207
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:41,759
You have to wear the boots.

208
00:15:41,847 --> 00:15:44,600
You can't wear those futuristic things
back in 1885.

209
00:15:44,687 --> 00:15:46,803
You shouldn't be wearing them
here in 1955.

210
00:15:46,887 --> 00:15:49,276
- As soon as I get there, I'll put them on.
- 0kay.

211
00:15:49,367 --> 00:15:51,801
I think we're about ready.
I put gas in the tank.

212
00:15:51,887 --> 00:15:53,559
Your future clothes are packed.

213
00:15:53,647 --> 00:15:57,356
Just in case,
fresh batteries for your walkie-talkies.

214
00:15:57,487 --> 00:15:59,796
What about that floating device?

215
00:16:00,007 --> 00:16:01,963
MARTY: Hoverboard.
D0C: All right.

216
00:16:03,767 --> 00:16:06,406
It's gonna be a long walk
back to Hill Valley from here.

217
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:08,359
It's still the safest plan.

218
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:11,200
We can't risk sending you back
into a populated area...

219
00:16:11,287 --> 00:16:13,482
...or to a spot that's geographically unknown.

220
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:16,764
You don't want to crash into some tree
that existed in the past.

221
00:16:16,847 --> 00:16:19,077
<i>This was all completely open country...</i>

222
00:16:19,167 --> 00:16:21,886
...so you'll have plenty of runout space
when you arrive.

223
00:16:21,967 --> 00:16:24,686
Remember, where you're going,
there are no roads.

224
00:16:24,767 --> 00:16:28,840
There's a small cave over there which will be
a good place to hide the time vehicle.

225
00:16:29,047 --> 00:16:32,244
The new time-circuit control tubes
are warmed up.

226
00:16:35,247 --> 00:16:36,362
Time circuits on.

227
00:16:36,447 --> 00:16:39,325
I wrote the letter on September 1,
so we'll send you to...

228
00:16:39,407 --> 00:16:42,877
...September 2, that's a Wednesday.
September 2, 1885, 8:00 a.m.

229
00:16:42,967 --> 00:16:45,845
I get shot on Monday the 7th.
You have five days to locate me.

230
00:16:45,927 --> 00:16:49,681
According to my letter, I'm a blacksmith,
so I probably have a shop somewhere.

231
00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:51,883
All you got to do is drive the time vehicle...

232
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:55,198
...directly toward that screen,
accelerating to 88 miles an hour.

233
00:16:55,287 --> 00:16:56,322
MARTY: Wait a minute.

234
00:16:56,407 --> 00:16:59,717
If I drive straight towards the screen,
I'll crash into those Indians.

235
00:16:59,847 --> 00:17:02,680
D0C:
Marty, you're not thinking fourth dimensionally.

236
00:17:03,007 --> 00:17:07,603
You'll instantly be transported to 1885
and those Indians won't even be there.

237
00:17:08,367 --> 00:17:09,356
Right.

238
00:17:11,807 --> 00:17:14,196
Good luck, for both of our sakes.

239
00:17:14,687 --> 00:17:16,518
See you in the future.

240
00:17:16,807 --> 00:17:19,037

- Exactly.

Theoretically speaking, could it be done?

534
00:39:24,567 --> 00:39:28,037
I suppose, if you had a straight
stretch of track with a level grade...

535

...and you weren't hauling no cars...
