1
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:52,417
<i>In the bleak days
of 1983,</i>

2
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:56,661
<i>as England languished in the doldrums
of a ruinous monetarist policy,</i>

3
00:00:57,157 --> 00:01:01,244
<i>the good, loyal men of the
Permanent Assurance Company,</i>

4
00:01:01,279 --> 00:01:05,296
<i>a once-proud family firm
recently fallen on hard times,</i>

5
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:11,137
<i>strained under the yoke of their
oppressive new corporate management.</i>

6
00:01:11,172 --> 00:01:13,139
Terrible.
Really terrible.

7
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,904
Row!

8
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:04,023
That's it, Evans.
You're fired.

9
00:02:04,058 --> 00:02:05,900
You heard me. Out.

10
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,464
Did you hear that?
He's been sacked.

11
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,537
Sacked?

12
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,771
Sacked? Come on, boys.
Let's get at 'em.

13
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:23,317
Hey!

14
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:27,555
Come on! Come on!

15
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,977
Let me out of here!

16
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:27,649
I demand
to see my lawyer!

17
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,293
Tooley! Come on.

18
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:07,078
Quiet! Silence!

19
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:09,280
Now, lads, let's move.

20
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:12,952
You, you and you,
break open the weapons.

21
00:04:12,987 --> 00:04:16,912
You, you and you,
into the rigging.

22
00:04:16,947 --> 00:04:20,837
And you, put the kettle on.
Aye, sir.

23
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,622
There, there, Charles.

24
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:11,809
Sorry!

25
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:14,256
Come on, Tooley.
This way!

26
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:43,081
Weigh the anchor!

27
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,811
Weigh the anchor.

28
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:54,278
<i>And so, The Crimson Permanent Assurance</i>

29
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:58,852
<i>was launched upon the high
seas of international finance.</i>

30
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:19,983
Come on, boy.
Watch it. Route. Route!

31
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,343
Cup of tea, dear?
Hey, Captain!

32
00:07:24,378 --> 00:07:27,414
Look! To starboard!

33
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:35,221
<i>There it lay,
the prize they sought.</i>

34
00:07:35,256 --> 00:07:37,522
Hard to starboard!

35
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:42,562
<i>A financial district swollen with
multinationals, conglomerates,</i>

36
00:07:42,597 --> 00:07:46,271
<i>and fat, bloated
merchant banks.</i>

37
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:52,309
All right, lads,
battle stations!

38
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:56,682
Come on! Move it! Move it! Move it!

39
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,706
All right, then. That's
enough. Take cover.

40
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:27,078
Down, down! Get down!

41
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:47,460
Down, down.

42
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:26,675
Hard to starboard!

43
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:51,862
Fire!

44
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:03,264
Eric! My balance sheets!

45
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:07,605
Ross! Get the readouts!

46
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:17,475
Stop him!
Eric!

47
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,013
Thanks!
Charge!

48
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,376
Come on! Grab it!

49
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:12,365
No, no! Let me! Let me!
Okay, Kane.

50
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:20,840
Cudgelled!

51
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:30,123
Gotcha!

52
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,152
You bastard!

53
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:09,264
Take this.

54
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,496
Here. File this.

55
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:30,152
Shit!

56
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:42,353
<i>And so, heartened
by their initial success,</i>

57
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:47,860
<i>the desperate and reasonably violent
men of The Permanent Assurance</i>

58
00:13:47,895 --> 00:13:51,170

59
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:55,905
<i>as the sun set
slowly in the west,</i>

60
00:13:56,535 --> 00:14:00,139
<i>the outstanding returns on
their bold business venture</i>

61
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:02,273

62
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:05,211
<i>Once-proud financial giants</i>

63
00:14:05,246 --> 00:14:07,657

64
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:11,692
<i>their assets stripped,</i>

65
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:16,064
<i>their policies in tatters.</i>

66
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:32,369
Full speed ahead,
Mr. Cohen!

67
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:35,841
<i>Up, up, up your premium
Up, up, up your premium</i>

68
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:39,562
<i>Scribble away
And balance the books</i>

69
00:14:39,597 --> 00:14:43,341
<i>Scribble away
But balance the books</i>

70
00:14:43,376 --> 00:14:47,449
<i>It's fun to charter
an accountant</i>

71
00:14:47,484 --> 00:14:51,488
<i>And sail the wide
accountancy</i>

72
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:54,961
<i>To find,
explore the funds offshore</i>

73
00:14:54,996 --> 00:14:58,400
<i>And skirt the shoals
of bankruptcy</i>

74
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:03,300
<i>It can be manly in insurance</i>

75
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:07,371
<i>We'll up your premium
semiannually</i>

76
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:11,610
<i>It's all tax-deductible
We're fairly incorruptible</i>

77
00:15:11,645 --> 00:15:14,979
<i>Sailing on
the wide accountancy</i>

78
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:18,651
<i>Sail away...
And so, they sailed off</i>

79
00:15:18,686 --> 00:15:21,418
<i>into the ledgers of history,</i>

80
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:24,121
<i>one by one, the financial

00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:26,727
<i>crumbling under the might

82
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,460
<i>Or so it would have been,</i>

83
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:32,965
<i>if certain modern theories
concerning the shape of the world</i>

84
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:37,443
<i>had not proved
to be disastrously wrong.</i>

85
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:16,668
Morning.
Morning.

86
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,579
Morning.

87
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:25,779
Morning.
Morning.

88
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,421
What's new?
Not much.

89
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,821
Morning!
Good morning! Morning!

90
00:17:35,856 --> 00:17:37,493
Morning!
Morning!

91
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:42,231
Frank was just asking
what's new. Was he?

92
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:44,664
Yes.

93
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,232
Hey, look.

94
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:51,304
Howard's being eaten.
Is he?

95
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:01,045
Makes you think, doesn't it? H mm.

96
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,187
I mean, what's it all about?
Beats me.

97
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,653
<i>Why are we here</i>

98
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:11,973
<i>What's life all about</i>

99
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:14,224
<i>Is God really real</i>

100
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,363
<i>Or is there some doubt</i>

101
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:22,901
<i>Well, tonight
we're going to sort it all out</i>

102
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:26,314
<i>For tonight
it's The Meaning of Life</i>

103
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:32,211
<i>What's the point
of all this hoax</i>

104
00:18:32,246 --> 00:18:35,948
<i>Is it the chicken
and the egg time</i>

105
00:18:35,983 --> 00:18:38,587
<i>Are we just yolks</i>

106
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:43,989
<i>Or perhaps we're just one
of God's little jokes</i>

107
00:18:44,024 --> 00:18:48,665
<i>Well, ça, c'est
le meaning of life</i>

108
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:51,862
<i>Is life just a game</i>

109
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:54,498
<i>Where we make up the rules</i>

110
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:59,448
<i>While we're searching
for something to say</i>

111
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:05,244
<i>Or are we just
simply spiralling coils</i>

112
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:08,712
<i>Of self-replicating DNA</i>

113
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:10,616
<i>Nay, nay, nay, nay, nay, nay
Nay, nay, nay, nay</i>

114
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:14,359
<i>What is life
What is our fate</i>

115
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:17,967
<i>Is there heaven and hell</i>

116
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:21,225
<i>Do we reincarnate</i>

117
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:26,130
<i>Is mankind evolving
or is it too late</i>

118
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:29,768
<i>Well, tonight
here's The Meaning of Life</i>

119
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:32,574
<i>For millions</i>

120
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:36,607
<i>This life
is a sad vale of tears</i>

121
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:40,920
<i>Sitting round
with really nothing to say</i>

122
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:44,414
<i>While scientists say</i>

123
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:47,886
<i>We're just
simply spiralling coils</i>

124
00:19:47,921 --> 00:19:50,921
<i>Of self-replicating DNA</i>

125
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:52,658
<i>Nay, nay, nay, nay, nay, nay
Nay, nay, nay, nay</i>

126
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:56,128
<i>So just why
Why are we here</i>

127
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:58,795
<i>And just what</i>

128
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,469
<i>What, what, what do we fear</i>

129
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:05,620
<i>Well, ce soir for a change</i>

130
00:20:05,655 --> 00:20:08,138
<i>It will all be made clear</i>

131
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:12,311
<i>For this is
The Meaning of Life</i>

132
00:20:12,346 --> 00:20:14,598
C'est le sens de la vie

133
00:20:14,633 --> 00:20:16,850
This is The Meaning of Life

134
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:22,556
<i>Part one.
The miracle of birth.</i>

135
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:53,550
One thousand and eight!

136
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,320
Mrs. Moore's contractions
are more frequent, Doctor.

137
00:20:55,355 --> 00:20:57,222
Good. Take her into
the fetus frightening room.

138
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:58,291
Right.

139
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:07,773
Jolly good.

140
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:11,855
It's a bit bare in here today, isn't it?

141
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:15,777
Yes. Yes. More
apparatus, please, Nurse.

142
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:19,945
The EEG, the BP monitor and
the AVV. Certainly, Doctor.

143
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,346
And get the machine
that goes 'ping. '

144
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:25,157
And get the most expensive machines
in case the administrator comes.

145
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:37,329
That's it. Bring it in. Bring
it right here. Behind me.

146
00:21:37,364 --> 00:21:40,364
Lovely, lovely.
Jolly good. That's better.

147
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:44,312
That's much, much better.
Yes, that's more like it.

148
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:48,540
Still something
missing, though.

149
00:21:48,575 --> 00:21:50,747
H mm?
H mm.

150
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:55,012
Patient.
Patient, yes.

151
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:57,416
Where's the patient? Patient!
Anyone seen the patient?

152
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:01,164
Here she is.
Bring it over here.

153
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:03,789
Mind the machines!
Sorry, Doctor.

154
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:05,155
Come along!

155
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,556
Come along.
J ump on it.

156
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:10,078
Hello. Now don't you worry.
We'll soon have you cured.

157
00:22:10,113 --> 00:22:13,565
Leave it all to us. You'll
never know what hit you.

158
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,251
Goodbye.
Goodbye.

159
00:22:15,286 --> 00:22:16,867
Drips up.
Injections.

160
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:18,403
Can I put the tube
in the baby's head?

161
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:19,738
Only if I can
do the episiotomy.

162
00:22:19,773 --> 00:22:20,872
Okay.
Thank you.

163
00:22:20,907 --> 00:22:21,873
Legs up.

164
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:25,844
Oh, come in. Come on in, all
of you. That's it. Jolly good.

165
00:22:25,879 --> 00:22:28,513
Come on. Come along. Spread round there.

166
00:22:28,548 --> 00:22:30,514
Who are you?
I'm the husband.

167
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:34,758
I'm sorry. Only people
involved are allowed in here.

168
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,621
What do I do?
Yes?

169
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:41,793
What do I do? Nothing,
dear. You're not qualified.

170
00:22:41,828 --> 00:22:44,396
Leave it to us.
What's that for?

171
00:22:44,431 --> 00:22:46,965
That's the machine
that goes 'ping. '

172
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:52,135
You see? That means
your baby is still alive.

173
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:55,674
And that's the most expensive
machine in the whole hospital.

174
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:58,276
Yes, it cost over three-quarters
of a million pounds.

175
00:22:58,311 --> 00:23:00,449
Aren't you lucky?

176
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:03,181
The administrator
is here, Doctor.

177
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:04,489
Switch everything on.

178
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,424
Morning, gentlemen.

179
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:08,952
Morning. Morning, gentlemen.
Morning.

180
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:10,822
Morning, Mr. Pycroft.
Mr. Pycroft.

181
00:23:10,857 --> 00:23:12,622
Oh, very impressive,
very impressive.

182
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:15,899
And what are you doing
this morning? It's a birth.

183
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:18,096
And what sort of thing
is that?

184
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:21,988
Well, that's when we take a
new baby out of a lady's tummy.

185
00:23:22,023 --> 00:23:25,613
Wonderful what we
can do nowadays.

186
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:29,880
I see you have the machine that
goes 'ping. ' This is my favorite.

187
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:32,876
You see, we lease this back
from the company we sold it to,

188
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:37,484
and that way, it comes under the monthly
current budget and not the capital account.

189
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,490
Thank you, thank you. We try to
do our best. Well, do carry on.

190
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:49,294
Oh, the vulva's dilating,
Doctor. Oh, yes, there's the head.

191
00:23:49,329 --> 00:23:52,531
Yes, four centimeters,
five, six centimeters.

192
00:23:52,566 --> 00:23:54,566
Lights!
Amplify the ping machine.

193
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:56,166
Masks up!
Suction!

194
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:58,537
Eyes down
for a full house!

195
00:23:58,572 --> 00:24:00,448
Here it comes.

196
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,808
And frighten it.

197
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:08,381
Thank you.
And the rough towels!

198
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:12,233
Show it to the mother.
That's enough.

199
00:24:12,268 --> 00:24:14,651
Right. Sedate her.
N umber the child.

200
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:17,325
Measure it, blood-type
it and isolate it.

201
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:19,724
Okay, show's over.

202
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:23,160
Is it a boy or a girl?

203
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:26,598
I think it's a little early to start
imposing roles on it, don't you?

204
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:29,966
Now, a word of advice. You may
find that you suffer for some time,

205
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:34,449
a totally irrational feeling of
depression, PND, as we doctors call it.

206
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:36,807
So, it's lots of
happy pills for you,

207
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:39,377
and you can find out all about
the birth when you get home.

208
00:24:39,412 --> 00:24:43,120
It's available on BetaMax,
VHS and Super 8.

209
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:52,557
<i>The miracle of birth,
part two. The third world.</i>

210
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:07,908
Oh, bloody hell.

211
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:19,728
Oh, get it, would you,
Deidre? All right, Mum.

212
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:32,731
Now whose teatime is it?
Mine!

213
00:25:32,766 --> 00:25:34,464
Come on.
Out you go.

214
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:37,334
Now, Vincent, Tessa,
Valerie, Janine,

215
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,737
Martha, Andrew, Thomas,
Walter, Pat, Linda,

216
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:43,842
Michael, Evadne, Alice, Dominique
and Sasha, it's your bedtime.

217
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:47,110
Now don't argue!

218
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:50,715
Laura, Alfred, Nigel,
Annie, Simon, Amanda...

219
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:54,286
Wait. I've got something
to tell the whole family.

220
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:57,659
Oh, quick. Go and get
the others in, Gordon.

221
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:02,227
The mill's closed.
There's no more work.

222
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:05,896
We're destitute.

223
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:09,367
Come in, my little loves. I've
got no option but to sell you all

224
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:11,005
for scientific experiments.

225
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,976
No, no, that's the way it is,
my loves.

226
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:17,340
Blame the Catholic Church

227
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:19,894
for not letting me wear one
of those little rubber things.

228
00:26:19,929 --> 00:26:22,379
Oh, they've done some
wonderful things in their time.

229
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:26,259
They've preserved the might and majesty,
even mystery of the Church of Rome,

230
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:31,356
and the sanctity of the sacrament,
the indivisible oneness of the Trinity,

231
00:26:31,391 --> 00:26:33,558
but if they'd let me wear one
of those little rubber things

232
00:26:33,593 --> 00:26:35,158
on the end of my cock,

233
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:37,661
we wouldn't be in the mess
we are now.

234
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:41,800
Couldn't Mummy have worn
some sort of pessary?

235
00:26:41,835 --> 00:26:43,066
Not if we're going
to remain members

236
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,410
of the fastest-growing
religion in the world, my boy.

237
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:50,175
He's right.
You see, we believe...

238
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:52,154
Well, let me put it like this.

239
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:54,846
<i>There are Jews in the world</i>

240
00:26:54,881 --> 00:26:56,791
<i>There are Buddhists</i>

241
00:26:56,915 --> 00:27:01,363
<i>There are Hindus
and Mormons and then</i>

242
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:06,091
<i>There are those
that follow Mohammed</i>

243
00:27:06,126 --> 00:27:10,463
<i>But I've never been
one of them</i>

244
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:15,599
<i>I'm a Roman Catholic</i>

245
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:19,135
<i>And have been since
before I was born</i>

246
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:22,924
<i>And the one thing
they say about Catholics</i>

247
00:27:22,959 --> 00:27:26,678
<i>Is they'll take you
as soon as you're warm</i>

248
00:27:26,713 --> 00:27:30,213
<i>You don't have
to be a six-footer</i>

249
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:33,752
<i>You don't have to
have a great brain</i>

250
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:37,775
<i>You don't have to
have any clothes on</i>

251
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:41,466
<i>You're a Catholic
the moment Dad came</i>

252
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:45,061
<i>Because</i>

253
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:49,767
<i>Every sperm is sacred</i>

254
00:27:49,802 --> 00:27:54,322
<i>Every sperm is great</i>

255
00:27:54,357 --> 00:27:58,289
<i>If a sperm is wasted</i>

256
00:27:58,324 --> 00:28:02,222
<i>God gets quite irate</i>

257
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:07,721
<i>Every sperm is sacred</i>

258
00:28:07,756 --> 00:28:11,827
<i>Every sperm is great</i>

259
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:16,431
<i>If a sperm is wasted</i>

260
00:28:16,466 --> 00:28:20,907
<i>God gets quite irate</i>

261
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:25,270
<i>Let the heathens spill theirs</i>

262
00:28:25,305 --> 00:28:29,639
<i>On the dusty ground</i>

263
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:32,814
<i>God shall make them pay</i>

264
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:38,116
<i>For each sperm
that can't be found</i>

265
00:28:38,151 --> 00:28:42,504
<i>Every sperm is wanted</i>

266
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:46,823
<i>Every sperm is good</i>

267
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:51,179
<i>Every sperm is needed</i>

268
00:28:51,214 --> 00:28:55,080
<i>In your neighborhood</i>

269
00:28:55,115 --> 00:28:58,947
<i>Hindu, Taoist, Mormon</i>

270
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:02,772
<i>Spill theirs just anywhere</i>

271
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:06,982
<i>But God loves those who treat</i>

272
00:29:07,017 --> 00:29:11,158
<i>Their semen with more care</i>

273
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:15,273
<i>Every sperm is sacred</i>

274
00:29:15,308 --> 00:29:18,997
<i>Every sperm is great</i>

275
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:23,211
<i>If a sperm is wasted</i>

276
00:29:23,246 --> 00:29:27,129
<i>God gets quite irate</i>

277
00:29:27,164 --> 00:29:31,013
<i>Every sperm is sacred</i>

278
00:29:31,402 --> 00:29:35,039
<i>Every sperm is good
Every sperm is good</i>

279
00:29:35,074 --> 00:29:38,679
<i>Every sperm is needed</i>

280
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:42,749
<i>In your neighborhood</i>

281
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:46,521
<i>Every sperm is useful</i>

282
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:50,487
<i>Every sperm is fine</i>

283
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:54,128
<i>God needs everybody's</i>

284
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,164
<i>Mine
And mine</i>

285
00:29:56,199 --> 00:29:57,770
<i>And mine</i>

286
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:16,813
<i>Let the pagans spill theirs</i>

287
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:20,385
<i>O'er mountain, hill and plain</i>

288
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:23,887
<i>God shall strike them down</i>

289
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:28,200
<i>For each sperm
that's spilt in vain</i>

290
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:32,463
<i>Every sperm is sacred</i>

291
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:36,299
<i>Every sperm is good</i>

292
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:40,021
<i>Every sperm is needed</i>

293
00:30:40,056 --> 00:30:43,702
<i>In your neighborhood</i>

294
00:30:43,737 --> 00:30:47,348
<i>Every sperm is sacred</i>

295
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:51,166
<i>Every sperm is great</i>

296
00:30:51,201 --> 00:30:54,854
<i>If a sperm is wasted</i>

297
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:57,220
<i>God gets</i>

298
00:30:57,255 --> 00:31:03,194
<i>Quite irate</i>

299
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:10,785
So you see my problem,
little ones.

300
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:13,071
I can't keep you all here
any longer.

301
00:31:13,106 --> 00:31:14,971
Speak up!

302
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:17,679
I can't keep you all here
any longer!

303
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:22,413
God has blessed us so much I
can't afford to feed you anymore.

304
00:31:22,448 --> 00:31:24,256
Couldn't you have
your balls cut off?

305
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:28,920
It's not as simple as
that, Nigel. God knows all.

306
00:31:28,955 --> 00:31:31,556
He'd see through
such a cheap trick.

307
00:31:31,591 --> 00:31:34,123
What we do to ourselves,
we do to Him.

308
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:36,561
You could have had them
pulled off in an accident.

309
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:40,798
No. Children, I know
you're trying to help,

310
00:31:40,833 --> 00:31:43,066
but believe me,
me mind's made up.

311
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:46,081
I've given this long
and careful thought,

312
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:48,973
and it has to be medical
experiments for the lot of you.

313
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:55,618
<i>Every sperm is sacred</i>

314
00:31:56,781 --> 00:32:01,457
<i>Every sperm is great</i>

315
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:06,224
Look at them. Bloody Catholics.
Filling the bloody world up

316
00:32:06,259 --> 00:32:09,826
with bloody people they
can't afford to bloody feed.

317
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:14,432
What are we, dear? Protestant,
and fiercely proud of it.

318
00:32:14,467 --> 00:32:17,200
Well, why do they have
so many children?

319
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:21,306
Because every time they have sexual
intercourse, they have to have a baby.

320
00:32:21,341 --> 00:32:24,542
But it's the same with us,
Harry. What do you mean?

321
00:32:24,577 --> 00:32:26,749
Well, I mean
we've got two children,

322
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:29,412
and we've had
sexual intercourse twice.

323
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:32,817
That's not the point. We could
have it any time we wanted.

324
00:32:32,852 --> 00:32:34,951
Really?
Oh, yes. And what's more,

325
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:37,455
because we don't believe
in all that Papist claptrap,

326
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:39,489
we can take precautions.

327
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:41,457
What, you mean
lock the door?

328
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:45,930
No, no. I mean because we are members
of the Protestant Reformed Church,

329
00:32:45,965 --> 00:32:47,899
which successfully challenged
the autocratic power

330
00:32:47,934 --> 00:32:50,033
of the Papacy
in the mid-sixteenth century,

331
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:53,104
we can wear little rubber
devices to prevent issue.

332
00:32:53,139 --> 00:32:54,203
What do you mean?

333
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:57,175
I could, if I wanted, have
sexual intercourse with you.

334
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:58,441
Oh, yes, Harry.

335
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:01,013
And by wearing a rubber sheath
over my old fellow,

336
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:04,816
I could ensure that when I came
off, you would not be impregnated.

337
00:33:04,851 --> 00:33:08,486
Ooh! That's what being
a Protestant's all about.

338
00:33:08,521 --> 00:33:10,055
That's why
it's the church for me.

339
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:11,554
That's why
it's the church for anyone

340
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:14,729
who respects the individual
and the individual's right

341
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:16,960
to decide for him
or herself.

342
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:20,799
When Martin Luther nailed his
protest up to the church door in 1517,

343
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:24,603
he may not have realized the full
significance of what he was doing

344
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,692
but 400 years later,
thanks to him, my dear,

345
00:33:27,727 --> 00:33:30,649
I can wear whatever I want
on my John Thomas.

346
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:34,879
And Protestantism doesn't stop
at the simple condom. Oh, no!

347
00:33:34,914 --> 00:33:37,818
I can wear French Ticklers
if I want. You what?

348
00:33:37,853 --> 00:33:40,722
French Ticklers, Black
Mambos, Crocodile Ribs...

349
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,586
Sheaths that are designed
not only to protect,

350
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:47,068
but also to enhance the
stimulation of sexual congress.

351
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:50,093
Have you got one?
Have I got one? Well, no,

352
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:53,297
but I can go down the road anytime
I want and walk into Harry's

353
00:33:53,332 --> 00:33:56,467
and hold my head up high and
say, in a loud, steady voice,

354
00:33:56,502 --> 00:33:59,035
'Harry, I want you
to sell me a condom.

355
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:02,983
'In fact, today I think I'll have a
French Tickler, for I am a Protestant. '

356
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:05,875
Well, why don't you?
But they, they cannot,

357
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:09,280
because their church never made the
great leap out of the Middle Ages

358
00:34:09,315 --> 00:34:12,548
and the domination
of alien Episcopal supremacy.

359
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:14,855
<i>But despite the attempts
of Protestants</i>

360
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:17,127
<i>to promote the idea
of sex for pleasure,</i>

361
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:20,400
<i>children continue
to multiply everywhere.</i>

362
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:26,202
<i>The Meaning of Life, part two.
Growth and learning.</i>

363
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:32,514
And spotteth twice they the
camels before the third hour.

364
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:36,377
And so the Midianites
went forth to Ram Gilead,

365
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,826
in Kadesh Bilgemath,

366
00:34:38,861 --> 00:34:41,044
by Shor Ethra Regalion,

367
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:45,481
to the house of
Gash-Bil-Bethuel-Bazda,

368
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:48,686
he who brought the butter dish
to Balshazar,

369
00:34:48,721 --> 00:34:51,856
and the tent peg
to the house of Rashomon,

370
00:34:51,891 --> 00:34:54,857
and there,
slew they the goats,

371
00:34:54,892 --> 00:35:00,398
yea, and placed they
the bits in little pots.

372
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,501
Here endeth the lesson.

373
00:35:03,536 --> 00:35:05,446
Let us praise God.

374
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:14,014
O Lord.
O Lord.

375
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:17,616
Ooh! You are so big.

376
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:20,706
Ooh! You are so big.

377
00:35:20,741 --> 00:35:23,497
So absolutely huge.

378
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:27,690
So absolutely huge.

379
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:32,867
Gosh, we're all really impressed
down here, I can tell You.

380
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:37,768
Gosh, we're all really impressed
down here, I can tell you.

381
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:42,375
Forgive us, O Lord, for this,
our dreadful toadying.

382
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:45,576
And barefaced flattery.

383
00:35:45,611 --> 00:35:48,763
But you're so strong,

384
00:35:48,798 --> 00:35:51,916
and, well, just so super.

385
00:35:51,951 --> 00:35:54,396
Fantastic.

386
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,953
Amen, Reverend.
Amen.

387
00:35:56,988 --> 00:36:00,358
Now two boys have been found
rubbing linseed oil

388
00:36:00,393 --> 00:36:02,394
into the school cormorant.

389
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:07,331
Now some of you may feel that the
cormorant does not play an important part

390
00:36:07,366 --> 00:36:09,504
in the life of the school,
but I would remind you

391
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:14,110
that it was presented to us by the
corporation of the town of Sudbury,

392
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:17,208
to commemorate Empire Day,
when we try to remember

393
00:36:17,243 --> 00:36:19,950
the names of all those
from the Sudbury area,

394
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:23,147
who so gallantly
gave their lives

395
00:36:23,182 --> 00:36:25,615
to keep China British.

396
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:30,121
So from now on, the cormorant
is strictly out of bounds!

397
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:34,857
Oh, and, Jenkins,

398
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:37,528
apparently, your mother
died this morning.

399
00:36:37,563 --> 00:36:39,769
Chaplain.

400
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:46,802
<i>O Lord, please don't burn us</i>

401
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:51,075
<i>Don't grill or toast
Your flock</i>

402
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:55,480
<i>Don't put us on the barbecue</i>

403
00:36:55,515 --> 00:36:59,815
<i>Or simmer us in stock</i>

404
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:03,521
<i>Don't braise
or bake or boil us</i>

405
00:37:03,556 --> 00:37:07,560
<i>Or stir-fry us in a wok</i>

406
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:12,738
<i>Oh, please don't
lightly poach us</i>

407
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:17,366
<i>Or baste us with hot fat</i>

408
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:21,906
<i>Don't fricassee or roast us</i>

409
00:37:21,941 --> 00:37:26,342
<i>Or boil us in a vat</i>

410
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:30,881
<i>And please don't
stick thy servants, Lord</i>

411
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:34,692
<i>In a Rotissomat</i>

412
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,093
He's coming!

413
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,845
All right, settle down,
settle down.

414
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:56,381
Now, before I begin the
lesson, will those of you

415
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:59,443
who are playing in the match this
afternoon move your clothes down

416
00:37:59,478 --> 00:38:02,413
onto the lower peg
immediately after lunch,

417
00:38:02,448 --> 00:38:03,879
before you write
your letter home,

418
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:06,633
if you're not getting your hair cut,
unless you've got a younger brother,

419
00:38:06,668 --> 00:38:09,353
who's going out this weekend as the
guest of another boy, in which case,

420
00:38:09,388 --> 00:38:11,120
collect his note before lunch,

421
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:13,422
put it in your letter after
you have had your haircut,

422
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:16,527
and make sure he moves your clothes
down onto the lower peg for you.

423
00:38:16,562 --> 00:38:17,596
Now...
Sir?

424
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:18,928
Yes, Wymer?

425
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:21,532
My younger brother's going out
with Dibble this weekend, sir.

426
00:38:21,567 --> 00:38:24,101
But I'm not having my hair cut
today, so do I move my clothes...

427
00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:27,471
I do wish you'd listen, Wymer.
It's perfectly simple.

428
00:38:27,506 --> 00:38:29,005
If you're not
getting your hair cut,

429
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,742
you don't have to move your brother's
clothes down to the lower peg.

430
00:38:31,777 --> 00:38:34,145
You simply collect his note
before lunch,

431
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:36,479
after you've done
your scripture prep,

432
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:39,183
when you've written
your letter home before rest,

433
00:38:39,218 --> 00:38:41,402
move your own clothes
onto the lower peg,

434
00:38:41,437 --> 00:38:43,587
greet the visitors
and report to Mr. Viney

435
00:38:43,622 --> 00:38:45,293
that you've had
your chit signed.

436
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:48,969
Now, sex.

437
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:54,840
Sex, sex, sex.
Where were we?

438
00:38:58,936 --> 00:39:00,803
Well, had I got as far as

439
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:04,581
the penis entering the vagina?

440
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:10,253
No, sir.
No, sir. No, sir.

441
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:12,826
Well, had I done foreplay?

442
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,219
Yes, sir.

443
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:20,589
Ah. Well, as we all know
all about foreplay,

444
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:24,936
no doubt you can tell me what
the purpose of foreplay is.

445
00:39:25,996 --> 00:39:27,566
Biggs.

446
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:33,638
Don't know.
Sorry, sir.

447
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:35,144
Carter?

448
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:39,752
Oh, was it taking
your clothes off, sir?

449
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:42,817
Well, and after that?

450
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,924
Oh, putting them
on a lower peg, sir.

451
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:52,590
The purpose of foreplay is to
cause the vagina to lubricate,

452
00:39:52,625 --> 00:39:56,333
so that the penis
can penetrate more easily.

453
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:58,396
Could we have a window open,
please, sir?

454
00:39:58,431 --> 00:40:00,029
Yes. Harris, will you?

455
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:02,669
And, of course, to cause
the man's penis to erect

456
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,109
and harden.

457
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:11,542
Now, did I do
vaginal juices last week?

458
00:40:11,577 --> 00:40:13,309
Oh, do pay attention,
Wadsworth!

459
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:15,646
I know it's Friday. Watching
the football, are you?

460
00:40:15,681 --> 00:40:18,922
Boy, move over there.
I'm warning you.

461
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:22,092
I may decide
to set an exam this term.

462
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:24,407
Oh, sir!
Sir!

463
00:40:24,442 --> 00:40:26,596
So just listen.

464
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:31,813
Now did I or did I not

465
00:40:31,848 --> 00:40:35,035
do vaginal juices?

466
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:36,866
Yes, sir.

467
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:41,076
Name two ways of getting them
flowing, Watson.

468
00:40:41,872 --> 00:40:43,476
Rubbing the clitoris, sir?

469
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:50,800
What's wrong
with a kiss, boy? H mm?

470
00:40:50,835 --> 00:40:53,989
Why not start her off
with a nice kiss?

471
00:40:54,151 --> 00:40:55,785
You don't
have to go leaping

472
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,922
straight for the clitoris
like a bull at a gate.

473
00:40:57,957 --> 00:41:00,231
Give her a kiss, boy.

474
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:04,662
Suck the nipple, sir?
Good, good. Well done, Wymer.

475
00:41:04,697 --> 00:41:07,064
Stroking the thighs, sir?
Yes, yes.

476
00:41:07,099 --> 00:41:09,167
I suppose so.
Biting the neck.

477
00:41:09,202 --> 00:41:11,200
Yes, good.
Nibbling the earlobe,

478
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:14,004
kneading the buttocks
and so on and so forth.

479
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:16,279
So we have
all these possibilities,

480
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:20,616
before we stampede
towards the clitoris, Watson.

481
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:22,912
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

482
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:26,183
Now, all these forms
of stimulation

483
00:41:26,218 --> 00:41:28,663
can now take place.

484
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:40,166
And, of course, tonguing
will give you the best idea

485
00:41:40,397 --> 00:41:44,067
of how the juices
are coming along.

486
00:41:44,102 --> 00:41:47,703
Helen?
Now, penetration and coitus,

487
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:51,811
that is to say intercourse
up to and including orgasm.

488
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:57,715
Ah, hello, dear. Do stand up when
my wife enters the room, Carter.

489
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:59,381
Oh, sorry, sir. Sorry.

490
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:01,116
Humphrey, I hope
you don't mind.

491
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:03,687
I told the Garfields we
would dine with them tonight.

492
00:42:03,722 --> 00:42:05,610
Yes, yes, well,
I suppose we must.

493
00:42:05,645 --> 00:42:07,499
I said we'd be
there by 8: 00.

494
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:10,367
At least it'll give me a reason
to wind up the staff meeting.

495
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:13,397
I know you don't like them, but
I couldn't make another excuse.

496
00:42:13,432 --> 00:42:15,206
It's just that I felt...

497
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,537
Wymer, this is
for your benefit.

498
00:42:19,572 --> 00:42:21,676
Would you kindly
wake up?

499
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:24,644
I've no intention of going
through this all again.

500
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:38,856
We'll take the foreplay as
read, if you don't mind, dear.

501
00:42:38,891 --> 00:42:39,989
No, of course not,
Humphrey.

502
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:44,595
So, the man starts by entering
or mounting his good lady wife,

503
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:46,428
in the standard way.

504
00:42:46,463 --> 00:42:51,639
The penis is now, as you will
observe, more or less fully erect.

505
00:42:51,802 --> 00:42:54,305
There we are,
that's better.

506
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:56,478
Now, Carter.

507
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:59,013
Yes, sir?
What is it?

508
00:43:00,611 --> 00:43:04,024
It's an ocarina, sir.
Bring it up here.

509
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:08,719
The man now starts making thrusting
movements with his pelvic area,

510
00:43:08,754 --> 00:43:12,206
moving the penis up and down
inside the vagina.

511
00:43:12,241 --> 00:43:15,624
Put it there, boy.
Put it there on the table.

512
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:19,730
While the wife maximizes her clitoral
stimulation by the shaft of the penis,

513
00:43:19,765 --> 00:43:21,349
by pushing forward.

514
00:43:21,384 --> 00:43:22,898
Thank you, dear.

515
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:25,202
Now, as the
sexual excitement mounts...

516
00:43:25,237 --> 00:43:27,306
What's funny, Biggs?

517
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:29,338
Oh, nothing, sir.

518
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:32,059
Do, please, share your little
joke with the rest of us.

519
00:43:32,094 --> 00:43:34,745
I mean, obviously, something
frightfully funny's going on.

520
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:35,978
No, honestly, sir.

521
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:37,413
Well, as it's so funny,

522
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:40,758
I think you'd better be selected
to play for the boys' team,

523
00:43:41,051 --> 00:43:43,463
in the rugby match against
the masters this afternoon.

524
00:43:44,555 --> 00:43:46,125
Oh, no, sir!

525
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:58,412
Come on, Buster!

526
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:08,314
Well played, well played.

527
00:45:31,795 --> 00:45:35,970
<i>The Meaning of Life, part
three. Fighting each other.</i>

528
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:45,080
Okay, Blackitt, Sturridge and Walters,
you take the buggers on the left flank.

529
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:47,144
Hordern, Spadger and I
will go for the gun post.

530
00:45:47,179 --> 00:45:48,210
Hang on, 68.

531
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:51,115
You'll never make it, let us come
with you. Do as you're told, man.

532
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:53,788
Righto, Skipper.
Oh, sir, sir?

533
00:45:53,984 --> 00:45:56,964
If we don't
meet again, sir.

534
00:45:57,187 --> 00:46:01,759
I'd just like to say it's been a real
privilege fighting alongside you, sir.

535
00:46:01,794 --> 00:46:05,227
Yes, well, this is hardly the time
or place for a goodbye speech, eh?

536
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:10,006
Me and the lads realize that, sir, but,
well, we may never meet again, so...

537
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,969
Yes, all right, Blackitt.
Thanks a lot.

538
00:46:12,004 --> 00:46:13,068
No, just a moment, sir.

539
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:16,209
Me and the lads, we've had
a little whip-around, sir.

540
00:46:16,473 --> 00:46:20,318
We've bought you something,
sir. We bought you this, sir.

541
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:24,279
Oh! Well, it...
I don't know what to say.

542
00:46:24,314 --> 00:46:28,752
It's a lovely thought.
Thank you. Thank you all.

543
00:46:28,787 --> 00:46:30,854
But I think
we'd better get to cover...

544
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:36,825
We've got something else
for you as well, sir.

545
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:39,696
Sorry it's another clock, sir,
only there was a bit of a mix-up.

546
00:46:39,731 --> 00:46:42,064
Walters thought
he was buying a present

547
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:44,636
and Spadger and I had
already got the other one.

548
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:47,704
Well, it's beautiful,
they're both beautiful.

549
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:51,858
I think we'd better
get to cover now.

550
00:46:51,893 --> 00:46:53,575
I'll thank you properly
later on.

551
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:55,746
Corporal Sturridge got this
for you as well, sir.

552
00:46:55,781 --> 00:46:57,780
He didn't know
about the others.

553
00:46:57,815 --> 00:47:00,851
It's Swiss. Well, now, that
is thoughtful, Sturridge.

554
00:47:00,886 --> 00:47:03,263
Good man.
And there's a card, sir.

555
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:07,164
From all of us,
sorry about the blood, sir.

556
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:08,557
Thank you all.

557
00:47:08,592 --> 00:47:11,728
Squad! Three cheers
for Captain Biggs.

558
00:47:11,763 --> 00:47:14,930
Hip, hip.
Hooray!

559
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:16,765
Hip, hip...

560
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,367
Blackitt! Blackitt!

561
00:47:18,402 --> 00:47:21,405
I'll be all right, sir. There's
just one other thing, sir.

562
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,675
Spadger, give him the check. Oh, yeah.

563
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:25,911
Oh, no, this is
really going too far.

564
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:29,546
I don't seem to be able to find
it, sir, be in number four trench.

565
00:47:29,581 --> 00:47:31,719
For Christ's sake,
forget it, man.

566
00:47:33,217 --> 00:47:35,560
You shouldn't
have said that, sir.

567
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:38,088
You've hurt his feelings, now.

568
00:47:38,123 --> 00:47:39,931
Don't mind me, Spadge.

569
00:47:40,057 --> 00:47:44,505
Toffs is all the same. One minute,
it's all please and thank you.

570
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:47,763
The next, they'll kick
you in the teeth. Yeah.

571
00:47:47,798 --> 00:47:50,899
Let's not give him the cake.
I don't want any cake.

572
00:47:50,934 --> 00:47:53,570
Look, Blackitt cooked it
especially for you, you bastard.

573
00:47:53,605 --> 00:47:56,206
Yeah, he saved his rations
for six weeks, sir.

574
00:47:56,241 --> 00:47:57,573
I don't mean
to be ungrateful.

575
00:47:57,608 --> 00:47:59,977
I'll be all right...

576
00:48:00,012 --> 00:48:02,311
Blackie! Blackie!

577
00:48:02,346 --> 00:48:06,250
Look at him! He worked on that cake
like no one else I've ever known.

578
00:48:06,285 --> 00:48:08,118
Some nights it was so cold
we could hardly move

579
00:48:08,153 --> 00:48:09,518
but Blackitt
would be out there,

580
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:12,554
slicing the lemons,
mixing the sugar and almonds.

581
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:16,758
I mean, you try getting butter
to melt at 15 degrees below zero.

582
00:48:16,793 --> 00:48:21,999
There's love in that cake, this
man's love and this man's care and...

583
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:27,113
Oh, my Christ!
You bastard.

584
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:32,247
All right, we will eat
the cake. They're right.

585
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:34,394
It's too good a cake
not to eat.

586
00:48:34,429 --> 00:48:36,346
Get the plates
and knives, Walters.

587
00:48:36,381 --> 00:48:37,681
Yes, sir.
How many plates?

588
00:48:37,716 --> 00:48:38,916
Six.

589
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:43,654
Oh, better make it five.
Tablecloth, sir?

590
00:48:43,689 --> 00:48:46,134
Yes, get the tablecloth.

591
00:48:47,124 --> 00:48:49,191
No, no,
I'll get the tablecloth.

592
00:48:49,226 --> 00:48:50,894
You better get
the gate leg table, Hordern.

593
00:48:52,296 --> 00:48:54,496
And the little lamp, sir?
Yes.

594
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:57,234
Oh, and while you're at it,
you'd better get a doily.

595
00:48:57,269 --> 00:48:59,369
I'll bring two, sir,
in case one gets crumpled.

596
00:48:59,404 --> 00:49:00,711
Okay!

597
00:49:04,341 --> 00:49:07,879
But, of course, warfare isn't
all fun. Right. Stop that.

598
00:49:08,145 --> 00:49:10,047
It's all very well
to laugh at the military,

599
00:49:10,082 --> 00:49:11,914
but when one considers
the meaning of life,

600
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:15,589
it is a struggle between alternative
viewpoints of life itself.

601
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:18,342
Without the ability to
defend one's own viewpoint,

602
00:49:18,377 --> 00:49:20,898
against other perhaps
more aggressive ideologies,

603
00:49:21,024 --> 00:49:25,028
then reasonableness and moderation
could quite simply disappear.

604
00:49:25,729 --> 00:49:28,363
That is why we'll always need an army.

605
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:30,901
May God strike me down
were it to be otherwise.

606
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:37,639
Don't stand there gawping,

607
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:40,409
like you've never seen
the hand of God before!

608
00:49:40,444 --> 00:49:44,982
Now, today we're going to do
marching up and down the square.

609
00:49:45,017 --> 00:49:49,396
That is, unless any of you
got anything better to do.

610
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:51,987
Well?

611
00:49:52,022 --> 00:49:54,224
Anyone got anything
they'd rather be doing,

612
00:49:54,259 --> 00:49:58,399
than marching up and down
the square?

613
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:02,576
Yes! Atkinson.

614
00:50:04,868 --> 00:50:09,905
What would you
rather be doing, Atkinson?

615
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:13,649
Well, to be quite honest, Sarge, I'd
rather be home with the wife and kids.

616
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:17,549
Would you now?

617
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:20,525
Yes, Sarge.
Right. Off you go.

618
00:50:21,218 --> 00:50:23,051
Now,

619
00:50:23,086 --> 00:50:25,862
everybody else happy
with my little plan,

620
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:28,859
of marching up and down
the square a bit?

621
00:50:28,894 --> 00:50:30,292
Sarge?
Yes?

622
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:32,062
I've got a book
I'd quite like to read.

623
00:50:32,097 --> 00:50:33,397
Go read your book then.

624
00:50:33,432 --> 00:50:34,637
Now!

625
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:40,045
Everybody else
quite content to join in

626
00:50:40,237 --> 00:50:43,673
with my little scheme
of marching

627
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:46,476
up and down the square?

628
00:50:46,511 --> 00:50:48,076
Sarge?

629
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:50,147
Yes, Wyclif,
what is it?

630
00:50:50,313 --> 00:50:53,917
Well, I'm learning the piano.

631
00:50:53,952 --> 00:50:55,919
Learning the piano?

632
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:59,022
Yes, Sarge.
And I suppose

633
00:50:59,057 --> 00:51:01,590
you want to go practice, eh?

634
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:05,695
Marching up and down the square
not good enough for you, eh?

635
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:08,263
Well...
Right! Off you go!

636
00:51:08,298 --> 00:51:11,369
Now, what about
the rest of you?

637
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:16,342
Rather be at the pictures,
I suppose.

638
00:51:18,975 --> 00:51:21,284
All right! Off you go!

639
00:51:24,781 --> 00:51:26,715
Bloody army. I don't know
what it's coming to.

640
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:29,619
Right. Sergeant Major marching
up and down the square.

641
00:51:29,654 --> 00:51:31,520
Left, right, left.

642
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:33,422
<i>Democracy and humanitarianism</i>

643
00:51:33,457 --> 00:51:35,759
<i>have always been trademarks
of the British Army.</i>

644
00:51:35,794 --> 00:51:37,159
<i>Rubbish!
Shh!</i>

645
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:41,403
<i>And have stamped its triumph in the
furthest-flung corners of the Empire.</i>

646
00:51:58,482 --> 00:52:01,758
<i>But no matter where or when
there was fighting to be done,</i>

647
00:52:01,918 --> 00:52:05,889
<i>it has always been the calm
leadership of the officer class</i>

648
00:52:05,924 --> 00:52:08,665
<i>that has made the British Army
what it is.</i>

649
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,571
Excuse me.

650
00:52:52,202 --> 00:52:54,477
Morning, Ainsworth.
Morning, Pakenham.

651
00:52:54,738 --> 00:52:57,474
Sleep well? Not bad.
Bitten to shreds, though.

652
00:52:57,509 --> 00:53:00,528
Must be that hole in
the bloody mosquito net.

653
00:53:00,563 --> 00:53:03,547
Yes, savage little blighters,
aren't they?

654
00:53:03,582 --> 00:53:05,547
Excuse me, sir.
Yes, Chadwick?

655
00:53:05,582 --> 00:53:08,318
I'm afraid Perkins got rather
badly bitten during the night.

656
00:53:08,353 --> 00:53:09,818
Well, so did we.

657
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:12,060
Yes, but I do think
Doctor ought to see him.

658
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:15,542
Well, go and fetch him then.
Right you are, sir.

659
00:53:15,577 --> 00:53:18,395
Suppose I'd better go along.
Coming, Pakenham?

660
00:53:18,430 --> 00:53:20,829
Yes, I suppose so.

661
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:23,708
Here, now.
Come on, boy.

662
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:35,110
Morning, Perkins.

663
00:53:35,145 --> 00:53:37,955
Morning, sir. What's
all the trouble, then?

664
00:53:38,181 --> 00:53:40,984
Bitten, sir.
During the night.

665
00:53:41,019 --> 00:53:42,250
Oh?

666
00:53:42,285 --> 00:53:44,526
The whole leg gone, eh?
Yes.

667
00:53:45,488 --> 00:53:47,088
How's it feel?

668
00:53:47,123 --> 00:53:50,860
Stings a bit. Well,
it would, wouldn't it?

669
00:53:50,895 --> 00:53:54,664
That's quite a bite
you've got there.

670
00:53:54,699 --> 00:53:56,533
Yes. A real beauty,
isn't it?

671
00:53:56,568 --> 00:53:58,333
Any idea how
it happened?

672
00:53:58,368 --> 00:54:01,189
None whatsoever.
Complete mystery to me.

673
00:54:01,224 --> 00:54:04,010
Woke up just now,
one sock too many.

674
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:05,976
You must have a hell
of a hole in your net.

675
00:54:06,011 --> 00:54:07,409
We've sent
for the doctor.

676
00:54:07,444 --> 00:54:11,147
Hardly worth it, is it?
Yes. Better safe than sorry.

677
00:54:11,182 --> 00:54:14,851
Yes. Good Lord, look at this.
By Jove! That's enormous.

678
00:54:14,886 --> 00:54:17,387
You don't think
it'll come back, do you?

679
00:54:17,422 --> 00:54:18,653
For more, you mean?

680
00:54:18,688 --> 00:54:20,223
You're right. We'd
better get this stitched.

681
00:54:20,258 --> 00:54:21,923
Right.
Hello, Doc!

682
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:26,394
Morning. I came as fast as
I could. Is something up?

683
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:31,241
Yes. During the night, old Perkins
got his leg bitten sort of off.

684
00:54:31,701 --> 00:54:34,671
Oh, yeah.
Been in the wars, have we?

685
00:54:34,706 --> 00:54:35,804
Yes.

686
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:38,376
Any headache?
Bowels all right?

687
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:42,581
Well, let's have a look at
this one leg of yours, then, eh?

688
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:46,314
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

689
00:54:46,349 --> 00:54:51,195
Yes, yes. Yes, yes. Yes, well,
this is nothing to worry about.

690
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:54,623
Oh, good. There's a lot of
it about. Probably a virus.

691
00:54:54,658 --> 00:54:57,661
Keep warm, plenty of rest and if
you're playing football or anything,

692
00:54:57,861 --> 00:54:59,596
try and favor
the other leg.

693
00:54:59,631 --> 00:55:01,363
Oh, righto.

694
00:55:01,398 --> 00:55:03,400
As right as rain
in a couple of days.

695
00:55:03,435 --> 00:55:05,352
Oh. Thanks for
the reassurance, Doc.

696
00:55:05,387 --> 00:55:07,235
Not at all.
That's what I'm here for.

697
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:09,806
Any other problems
I can reassure you about?

698
00:55:09,841 --> 00:55:11,172
No, I'm fine.

699
00:55:11,207 --> 00:55:13,448
Jolly good.
Well, must be off.

700
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:17,114
So it'll just grow back again,
then, will it?

701
00:55:18,214 --> 00:55:19,351
U h...

702
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:23,820
I think I'd better come
clean with you about this.

703
00:55:23,855 --> 00:55:27,455
It's not a virus,
I'm afraid.

704
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:31,526
You see, a virus is what we
doctors call very, very small,

705
00:55:31,561 --> 00:55:35,196
so small it could not possibly
have made off with a whole leg.

706
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:38,068
What we're looking for, and this
is no more than an educated guess,

707
00:55:38,103 --> 00:55:39,334
I'd like to make that clear,

708
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:41,670
is some multi-cellular
life-form

709
00:55:41,705 --> 00:55:46,242
with stripes, huge, razor-sharp
teeth, about 11-foot long

710
00:55:46,277 --> 00:55:48,710
<i>and of the genus
Felis Horribilis.</i>

711
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:52,624
What we doctors,
in fact, call a tiger.

712
00:55:52,782 --> 00:55:56,629
A tiger?

713
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:02,759
A tiger in Africa?
H mm?

714
00:56:02,794 --> 00:56:04,465
A tiger in Africa!

715
00:56:06,563 --> 00:56:08,898
Ah, well, it's probably
escaped from a zoo.

716
00:56:08,933 --> 00:56:10,851
Doesn't sound
very likely to me.

717
00:56:10,886 --> 00:56:12,734
Mmm-mmm-mmm.
Sir! Sir!

718
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:15,438
The attack's over, sir.
The Zulus are retreating.

719
00:56:15,473 --> 00:56:16,604
Oh, jolly good.

720
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:18,591
Quite a lot of
casualties, sir.

721
00:56:18,626 --> 00:56:20,508
C- division wiped out.
Signals gone.

722
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:22,929
Thirty men killed in
F-section. Yes, I see.

723
00:56:22,964 --> 00:56:25,315
I should think about
150 men altogether, sir.

724
00:56:25,350 --> 00:56:26,548
Jolly good.

725
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:27,849
I haven't got
the final figures,

726
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:30,018
but there's a lot of seriously
wounded in the compound...

727
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:33,796
Yes, well, the thing is, Sergeant,
I've got a bit of a problem here.

728
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:38,595
One of the officers
has lost a leg.

729
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:41,115
Oh, no, sir!
I'm afraid so.

730
00:56:41,150 --> 00:56:43,600
Probably a tiger.
In Africa?

731
00:56:44,834 --> 00:56:48,805
The MO says we can stitch it back
on if we can find it immediately.

732
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:51,139
Right, sir.
I'll organize a party.

733
00:56:51,174 --> 00:56:53,877
It's hardly the time
for that, Sergeant.

734
00:56:53,912 --> 00:56:57,586
A search party.
Much better idea.

735
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:03,785
Sorry about the mess, sir.

736
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:06,589
We'll try and get it cleared
up by the time you get back.

737
00:57:06,624 --> 00:57:08,723
We showed 'em, didn't we, sir? Yes.

738
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:11,226
Here. We got a search party.
Leave that alone.

739
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:14,130
All this killing, bloodshed.
Bloody good fun, sir, isn't it?

740
00:57:14,165 --> 00:57:15,263
Yes, very good.

741
00:57:15,298 --> 00:57:16,464
Morning, sir.

742
00:57:16,499 --> 00:57:17,934
Nasty wound
you've got there, fella.

743
00:57:17,969 --> 00:57:19,777
Thank you very much, sir.

744
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:22,917
Come on, Private.
Making up a search party.

745
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:26,941
Better than staying home,
isn't it?

746
00:57:26,976 --> 00:57:29,545
I mean, at home if you kill
someone, they arrest you.

747
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:32,080
Here, they give you a gun
and show you what to do, sir.

748
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:36,953
I mean, I killed 15 of those
buggers, sir. At home, they'd hang me.

749
00:57:36,988 --> 00:57:39,330
Here, they'll give me
a fucking medal, sir.

750
00:57:56,573 --> 00:57:59,644
Sorry, sir.
Thank you, Sergeant Major.

751
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:19,371
Look!

752
00:58:20,763 --> 00:58:22,902
My God! It's huge!

753
00:58:32,775 --> 00:58:35,414
Don't shoot. Don't
shoot. We're not a tiger.

754
00:58:36,946 --> 00:58:39,221
We were just...

755
00:58:39,716 --> 00:58:41,786
Why are you dressed
as a tiger?

756
00:58:44,087 --> 00:58:46,154
Oh, why, why, why?

757
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:47,889
Isn't it a lovely
day today?

758
00:58:47,924 --> 00:58:51,292
Answer the question.
Oh, we were just...

759
00:58:51,327 --> 00:58:55,240
Well, actually, we're
dressed like this because...

760
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:57,866
Oh, no, that's not it.

761
00:58:57,901 --> 00:59:00,737
Oh, we did it for a laugh.
Part of a spree. High spirits.

762
00:59:00,772 --> 00:59:03,547
Simple as that.
Nothing more to it.

763
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:06,853
Well, actually, we're on a
mission for British Intelligence.

764
00:59:07,176 --> 00:59:09,746
There's a pro-czarist
Asante chief...

765
00:59:09,781 --> 00:59:11,713
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no.

766
00:59:11,748 --> 00:59:14,017
No, no, no, no. We're doing
it for an advertisement.

767
00:59:14,052 --> 00:59:16,603
Ah, that's it.
Forget about the Russians.

768
00:59:16,638 --> 00:59:19,155
We're doing an advert
for Tiger Brand Coffee.

769
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:20,755
'Tiger Brand Coffee
is a real treat.

770
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:23,359
'Even tigers prefer
a cup of it to real meat. '

771
00:59:23,394 --> 00:59:25,793
Now, look...
All right, all right.

772
00:59:25,828 --> 00:59:29,198
We are dressed as a tiger because
he had an auntie who did it in 1839.

773
00:59:29,233 --> 00:59:32,468
This is the 50th anniversary.
No. We're doing it for a bet.

774
00:59:32,503 --> 00:59:33,535
God told us to do it.

775
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:36,371
To tell the truth,
we are completely mad.

776
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:38,840
We're inmates of a Bengali
psychiatric institution,

777
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:43,646
and we escaped by making this skin
out of old used cereal packets.

778
00:59:43,681 --> 00:59:46,014
It doesn't matter!
What?

779
00:59:46,049 --> 00:59:51,321
It doesn't matter why they're dressed
as a tiger. Have they got my leg?

780
00:59:51,356 --> 00:59:54,090
Good thinking.
Well, have you?

781
00:59:54,125 --> 00:59:56,457
Actually...
Yes?

782
00:59:56,492 --> 00:59:58,726
We were thinking of
training as taxidermists.

783
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:00,897
We wanted to get the feel of it
from the animal's point of view.

784
01:00:00,932 --> 01:00:01,963
Be quiet!

785
01:00:01,998 --> 01:00:04,221
Now look,
we're just asking you

786
01:00:04,256 --> 01:00:06,445
if you've got
this man's leg.

787
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:09,537
A wooden leg?
No, no, a proper leg.

788
01:00:09,572 --> 01:00:14,612
He was fast asleep, and someone or
something came in and removed it.

789
01:00:15,545 --> 01:00:17,217
Without waking him up?

790
01:00:19,515 --> 01:00:21,783
Yes.
I don't believe you.

791
01:00:21,818 --> 01:00:24,621
We found the tiger skin
in a bicycle shop in Cairo.

792
01:00:24,656 --> 01:00:26,522
The owner wanted it
taken to Dar Es Salaam.

793
01:00:26,557 --> 01:00:27,555
Shut up!

794
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:31,265
Now look, have you or
have you not got his leg?

795
01:00:31,427 --> 01:00:35,272
Yes. No. No, no, no, no.
No. No, no, no.

796
01:00:36,766 --> 01:00:39,435
Why did you say yes?
I didn't.

797
01:00:39,470 --> 01:00:41,039
I'm not talking to you.

798
01:00:43,072 --> 01:00:46,815
U m...

799
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:50,456
Right. Search the thicket.

800
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:53,247
Oh, come on.
I mean, do we look like

801
01:00:53,282 --> 01:00:55,116
the sort of chaps who'd
creep into a camp at night,

802
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:58,154
steal into someone's tent,
anaesthetize them, tissue-type them,

803
01:00:58,189 --> 01:01:00,395
amputate a leg
and run away with it?

804
01:01:00,957 --> 01:01:02,561
Search the thicket.

805
01:01:02,859 --> 01:01:05,426
Oh, leg!
You're looking for a leg!

806
01:01:05,461 --> 01:01:07,797
Actually, I think there
is one there somewhere.

807
01:01:07,832 --> 01:01:09,649
Somebody must have
abandoned it here,

808
01:01:09,684 --> 01:01:11,432
knowing you were
coming after it.

809
01:01:11,467 --> 01:01:13,469
We stumbled across it, actually,
and wondered what it was.

810
01:01:13,504 --> 01:01:15,877
They'll be miles away
by now.

811
01:01:15,912 --> 01:01:18,251
We'll have to take
all the blame.

812
01:01:18,641 --> 01:01:22,884
Hello, good evening and welcome
to The Middle of the Film.

813
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:32,353
<i>Hello and welcome
to The Middle of the Film,</i>

814
01:01:32,388 --> 01:01:35,191
the moment where we take a break
and invite you, the audience,

815
01:01:35,226 --> 01:01:38,695
to join us, the filmmakers,
in Find the Fish.

816
01:01:40,063 --> 01:01:42,331
We're going to show you
a scene from another film

817
01:01:42,366 --> 01:01:45,133
and ask you to guess
where the fish is.

818
01:01:45,168 --> 01:01:48,004
But if you think you know,
don't keep it to yourselves.

819
01:01:48,039 --> 01:01:50,473
Yell out so that all
the cinema can hear you.

820
01:01:50,508 --> 01:01:53,510
So here we are
with Find the Fish.

821
01:02:03,186 --> 01:02:07,090
I wonder
where that fish has gone.

822
01:02:07,125 --> 01:02:09,057
You did love it so.

823
01:02:09,092 --> 01:02:12,845
You looked after it
like a son.

824
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:16,564
And it went
wherever I did go.

825
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:20,268
Is it in the cupboard?
Yes! No!

826
01:02:20,303 --> 01:02:24,707
Wouldn't you like to know?
It was a lovely little fish.

827
01:02:24,742 --> 01:02:29,577
And it went
wherever I did go.

828
01:02:29,612 --> 01:02:34,015
It's behind the sofa!
Where can that fish be?

829
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:36,552
Have you thought of the
drawers in the bureau?

830
01:02:36,587 --> 01:02:40,290
It is a most
elusive fish.

831
01:02:40,325 --> 01:02:44,278
And it went
wherever I did go.

832
01:02:44,313 --> 01:02:48,231
Oh! Fishy, fishy,
fishy, fish.

833
01:02:48,266 --> 01:02:52,867
Fish, fish, fishy, oh!

834
01:02:52,902 --> 01:02:57,540
Oh! Fishy, fishy,
fishy, fish!

835
01:02:57,575 --> 01:03:02,143
That went
wherever I did go.

836
01:03:02,178 --> 01:03:05,782
Look up his trunk! Yeah!
It's in his trousers!

837
01:03:05,817 --> 01:03:08,216
That was terrific!
Great! Yeah!

838
01:03:08,251 --> 01:03:11,921
Best bit so far.
Fantastic! Really great!

839
01:03:11,956 --> 01:03:14,196
Really risky, yeah.

840
01:03:17,693 --> 01:03:21,464
They haven't said much about the
meaning of life so far, have they?

841
01:03:21,499 --> 01:03:24,251
Well, it's been building
up to it. Has it?

842
01:03:24,286 --> 01:03:27,003
Yeah, I expect
they'll get onto it now.

843
01:03:27,038 --> 01:03:28,770
Personally, I doubt

844
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:31,541
they're going to say anything
about the meaning of life at all.

845
01:03:31,576 --> 01:03:33,309
Oh, come on.
They've gotta say something.

846
01:03:33,344 --> 01:03:34,644
They're bound to.

847
01:03:34,679 --> 01:03:36,555
Yeah.

848
01:03:39,615 --> 01:03:41,751
What do you think
the next bit will be?

849
01:03:41,786 --> 01:03:42,784
Caption, I expect.

850
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:46,222
What, about the next stage of life,
you mean? Oh, yeah. Here we go.

851
01:03:46,257 --> 01:03:47,789
<i>Middle Age.</i>

852
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:49,598
<i>Could've guessed it.</i>

853
01:03:55,198 --> 01:03:57,433
That's much better.
Thank you, honey.

854
01:03:57,468 --> 01:03:58,639
You're welcome.

855
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:02,205
It was all sort of
misty before.

856
01:04:03,306 --> 01:04:06,576
That's fine.
Hey! How are you?

857
01:04:06,611 --> 01:04:08,042
Oh, we're just fine.

858
01:04:08,077 --> 01:04:10,513
What kind of food you
like to eat this evening?

859
01:04:10,548 --> 01:04:12,715
Well, we sort of
like pineapple.

860
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:14,715
Yeah, we love pineapple.

861
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:17,687
Yeah, anything with
pineapple in is great for us.

862
01:04:17,722 --> 01:04:20,323
Well, how 'bout
the dungeon room?

863
01:04:20,358 --> 01:04:21,856
Oh, that sounds fine.

864
01:04:21,891 --> 01:04:23,991
Sure is.
It's real Hawaiian food,

865
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:28,497
served in an authentic medieval
English dungeon atmosphere.

866
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:46,549
Isn't this nice?
How are ya?

867
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:51,592
Take a little Kodak. Oh,
thank you. Thank you very much.

868
01:05:06,135 --> 01:05:09,405
Good evening. Would you care
for something to talk about?

869
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:11,372
Oh, that would
be wonderful.

870
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:13,759
Our special tonight
is minorities.

871
01:05:13,794 --> 01:05:16,077
Oh, that sounds
real interesting.

872
01:05:16,112 --> 01:05:19,680
What's this conversation
here? That's football.

873
01:05:19,715 --> 01:05:22,651
You can talk about the
Steelers-Bears game Saturday,

874
01:05:22,686 --> 01:05:25,588
or you could reminisce about
really great World Series.

875
01:05:25,623 --> 01:05:28,728
No, no, no.
What is this one here?

876
01:05:28,763 --> 01:05:31,834
That's philosophy.
Is that a sport?

877
01:05:32,295 --> 01:05:34,528
No, it's more of an attempt

878
01:05:34,563 --> 01:05:38,567
to construct a viable hypothesis
to explain the meaning of life.

879
01:05:38,602 --> 01:05:41,737
What was that?
What's he saying?

880
01:05:41,772 --> 01:05:43,604
Oh, that sounds wonderful.

881
01:05:43,639 --> 01:05:46,483
Would you like to talk about
the meaning of life, darling?

882
01:05:47,109 --> 01:05:48,709
Sure. Why not?

883
01:05:48,744 --> 01:05:50,947
Philosophy for two?
Right.

884
01:05:50,982 --> 01:05:53,116
Room?
259.

885
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:55,216
259.
Yeah.

886
01:05:55,251 --> 01:05:58,119
How do we...

887
01:05:58,154 --> 01:06:00,489
Oh, you folks
want me to start you off?

888
01:06:00,524 --> 01:06:02,976
We'd appreciate that.

889
01:06:03,011 --> 01:06:05,393
Okay! Well, look.

890
01:06:05,428 --> 01:06:08,602
Have you ever wondered
just why you're here?

891
01:06:10,533 --> 01:06:13,703
Well, we went to Miami last year
and California the year before...

892
01:06:13,738 --> 01:06:17,343
No, no, no. I mean, why
we're here, on this planet.

893
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:21,909
No.

894
01:06:21,944 --> 01:06:26,153
Right. You ever wanted to
know what it's all about?

895
01:06:26,382 --> 01:06:27,826
Nope.

896
01:06:28,117 --> 01:06:31,185
Righty-ho! Well,

897
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:34,642
see, throughout history, there've
been certain men and women,

898
01:06:34,677 --> 01:06:38,065
who've tried to find the solution
to the mysteries of existence.

899
01:06:38,361 --> 01:06:39,427
Great!

900
01:06:39,462 --> 01:06:41,462
And we call these guys
philosophers.

901
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:43,799
Oh! And that's what we're talking about.

902
01:06:43,834 --> 01:06:45,900
Right!
Oh, that's neat.

903
01:06:45,935 --> 01:06:47,802
Well, you look like
you're getting the idea,

904
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:50,504
so why don't I give you
these conversation cards.

905
01:06:50,539 --> 01:06:55,077
They'll tell you a little about philosophical
method, names of famous philosophers.

906
01:06:55,112 --> 01:06:57,747
There you are.
Have a nice conversation.

907
01:06:57,782 --> 01:06:59,714
Oh, thank you
very much.

908
01:06:59,749 --> 01:07:02,883
He's cute.
Yeah, real understanding.

909
01:07:02,918 --> 01:07:07,264
Oh! I never knew Schopenhauer
was a philosopher.

910
01:07:08,624 --> 01:07:12,230
Oh, yeah. He's the one
that begins with an 'S.'

911
01:07:15,131 --> 01:07:16,405
Oh.

912
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:20,805
Like Nietzsche.

913
01:07:22,772 --> 01:07:24,717
Does Nietzsche
begin with an 'S'?

914
01:07:26,642 --> 01:07:29,349
There's an 'S' in Nietzsche.

915
01:07:31,013 --> 01:07:33,288
Oh, well, yes, there is.

916
01:07:34,183 --> 01:07:36,458
Do all philosophers
have an 'S' in them?

917
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:39,161
Yeah. I think most of them do.

918
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:44,170
Oh. Does that mean Selena
Jones is a philosopher?

919
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:47,469
Yeah! Right! She could be.

920
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:49,834
She sings about
the meaning of life.

921
01:07:49,965 --> 01:07:54,870
Yeah. That's right, but I don't
think she writes her own material.

922
01:07:54,905 --> 01:07:58,874
No. Oh, maybe Schopenhauer
writes her material.

923
01:07:59,275 --> 01:08:01,652
No. Burt Bacharach writes it.

924
01:08:03,012 --> 01:08:04,923
There's no 'S'
in Burt Bacharach.

925
01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:07,251
Or in Hal David.

926
01:08:08,384 --> 01:08:09,988
Who's Hal David?

927
01:08:10,386 --> 01:08:13,774
He writes the lyrics.
Burt just writes the tunes.

928
01:08:13,809 --> 01:08:17,162
Only now, he's married
to Carole Bayer Sager.

929
01:08:20,429 --> 01:08:23,364
Waiter? This conversation
isn't very good.

930
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:28,604
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. We do have
one today that's not on the menu.

931
01:08:28,639 --> 01:08:30,673
It's sort of a speciality
of the house, you know?

932
01:08:30,708 --> 01:08:32,618
Live organ transplants.

933
01:08:33,576 --> 01:08:36,056
Live organ transplants?
What's that?

934
01:08:38,347 --> 01:08:42,761
<i>The Meaning of Life, part
five. Live organ transplants.</i>

935
01:08:45,721 --> 01:08:48,090
Don't worry, dear.
I'll get it.

936
01:08:55,464 --> 01:08:58,137
Yes?
Hello. Can we have your liver?

937
01:08:58,934 --> 01:09:00,777
What?
Your liver.

938
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:04,978
It's a large glandular organ
in your abdomen.

939
01:09:06,876 --> 01:09:10,280
You know, it's
reddish-brown, it's sort of...

940
01:09:10,315 --> 01:09:13,685
Yeah, yeah, I know what
it is, but I'm using it.

941
01:09:16,051 --> 01:09:19,259
Come on, sir. Don't muck
us about. Hey, hey, hey!

942
01:09:20,222 --> 01:09:21,632
Hello!

943
01:09:23,893 --> 01:09:26,529
What's this, then?
A liver donor's card.

944
01:09:26,564 --> 01:09:28,596
Need we say more?
No.

945
01:09:28,631 --> 01:09:32,501
Listen, I can't give it to you now.
It says, 'In the event of death. '

946
01:09:32,536 --> 01:09:33,767
My God!

947
01:09:33,802 --> 01:09:37,506
No one has ever had their liver
taken out by us and survived.

948
01:09:37,541 --> 01:09:39,781
Just lie there, sir.
It won't take a minute.

949
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:56,223
Here. What's going on?

950
01:09:56,258 --> 01:09:58,032
He's donating
his liver, madam.

951
01:09:59,395 --> 01:10:02,431
Is this because he took out
one of those silly cards?

952
01:10:02,466 --> 01:10:05,399
That's right, madam.
Typical of him.

953
01:10:05,434 --> 01:10:09,238
He goes down to the public
library, sees a few signs up,

954
01:10:09,273 --> 01:10:11,684
comes home all full
of good intentions.

955
01:10:12,441 --> 01:10:16,478
He gives blood, does cold
research, all that sort of thing.

956
01:10:20,449 --> 01:10:22,951
What do you do
with them all, anyway?

957
01:10:22,986 --> 01:10:25,454
They all go to
saving lives, madam.

958
01:10:25,489 --> 01:10:26,954
That's what
he used to say.

959
01:10:26,989 --> 01:10:29,391
'It's all for the good of
the country,' he used to say.

960
01:10:30,926 --> 01:10:33,372
Do you think it's all for
the good of the country?

961
01:10:33,529 --> 01:10:34,595
H mm?

962
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:37,132
Do you think it's all for
the good of the country?

963
01:10:37,167 --> 01:10:38,636
I wouldn't
know about that, madam.

964
01:10:38,671 --> 01:10:40,106
We're just doing our jobs,
you know?

965
01:10:42,605 --> 01:10:45,017
You're not doctors, then?

966
01:10:45,841 --> 01:10:47,581
Oh, blimey, no.

967
01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:51,178
Mum, Dad,
I'm off out now.

968
01:10:51,213 --> 01:10:53,784
I'll see you about 7: 00?
Righto, son.

969
01:10:53,949 --> 01:10:55,951
Look after yourself.

970
01:11:00,522 --> 01:11:03,593
You fancy
a cup of tea?

971
01:11:04,426 --> 01:11:07,031
Oh, well, that'd be
very nice. Thank you.

972
01:11:07,596 --> 01:11:10,201
Thank you very much, madam. Thank you.

973
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:13,777
I thought
she'd never ask.

974
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:20,241
You do realize

975
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:25,122
he has to be, well, dead,
by the terms of the card,

976
01:11:25,581 --> 01:11:27,560
before he donates his liver.

977
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:31,854
Well, I told him that, but he
never listens to me, silly man.

978
01:11:31,889 --> 01:11:33,890
I mean,
I was wonderin'...

979
01:11:34,723 --> 01:11:37,326
Well, you know, what you was
thinkin' of doin' after that.

980
01:11:37,361 --> 01:11:40,204
I mean, will you stay
on your own?

981
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:45,142
Or is there, well,
someone else, sort of,

982
01:11:47,036 --> 01:11:48,412
on the horizon?

983
01:11:48,771 --> 01:11:52,141
I'm too old for that sort
of thing. I'm past my prime.

984
01:11:52,176 --> 01:11:55,349
Not at all.
Very attractive woman.

985
01:11:56,078 --> 01:11:59,582
Well, I'm certainly not thinking
of getting hitched up again.

986
01:12:01,183 --> 01:12:02,923
Sure?
Sure.

987
01:12:11,427 --> 01:12:15,136
Can we have your liver
then? I would be scared.

988
01:12:15,264 --> 01:12:16,538
All right.

989
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:19,874
I'll tell you what.

990
01:12:21,203 --> 01:12:22,545
Listen to this.

991
01:12:23,238 --> 01:12:26,116
<i>Whenever life gets
you down, Mrs. Brown</i>

992
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:29,084
<i>And things seem hard
or tough</i>

993
01:12:29,745 --> 01:12:34,023
<i>And people are stupid,
obnoxious or daft</i>

994
01:12:34,616 --> 01:12:37,062
<i>and you feel
that you've had</i>

995
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:40,625
<i>quite enough.</i>

996
01:12:43,726 --> 01:12:46,712
<i>Just remember
that you're standing</i>

997
01:12:46,747 --> 01:12:49,663
<i>On a planet
that's evolving</i>

998
01:12:49,698 --> 01:12:52,838
<i>And revolving
at 900 miles an hour</i>

999
01:12:53,602 --> 01:12:57,706
<i>It's orbiting at 19 miles
a second so it's reckoned</i>

1000
01:12:57,741 --> 01:13:01,278
<i>A sun that is the source
of all our power</i>

1001
01:13:01,643 --> 01:13:05,147
<i>The sun and you and me and
all the stars that we can see</i>

1002
01:13:05,614 --> 01:13:09,084
<i>Are moving
at a million miles a day</i>

1003
01:13:09,485 --> 01:13:13,555
<i>In an outer spiral arm
at 40,000 miles an hour</i>

1004
01:13:13,590 --> 01:13:16,297
<i>Of the galaxy
we call the Milky Way</i>

1005
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:29,076
<i>Our galaxy itself contains
a hundred billion stars</i>

1006
01:13:29,111 --> 01:13:32,751
<i>It's a hundred thousand
light years side to side</i>

1007
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:37,032
<i>It bulges in the middle
16,000 light years thick</i>

1008
01:13:37,067 --> 01:13:40,655
<i>But out by us, it's just
3,000 light years wide</i>

1009
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:45,020
<i>We're 30,000 light years
from galactic central point</i>

1010
01:13:45,055 --> 01:13:48,524
<i>We go round
every 200 million years</i>

1011
01:13:49,057 --> 01:13:52,795
<i>And our galaxy is only
one of millions of billions</i>

1012

on expanding and expanding</i>

1014
01:14:33,170 --> 01:14:36,480
<i>In all of the directions
it can whizz</i>

1015
01:14:37,005 --> 01:14:40,874
<i>As fast as it can go
The speed of light, you know</i>

1016
01:14:40,909 --> 01:14:44,480
<i>Twelve million miles a minute and
that's the fastest speed there is</i>

1017
01:14:44,515 --> 01:14:48,519
<i>So remember when you're
feeling very small and insecure</i>

1018
01:14:48,951 --> 01:14:52,523
<i>How amazingly unlikely
is your birth</i>

1019
01:14:52,888 --> 01:14:56,492
<i>And pray that there's intelligent
life somewhere up in space</i>

1020
01:14:56,527 --> 01:14:59,404
<i>'Cause there's bugger all
down here on Earth</i>

1021
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,903
Makes you feel so, sort of
insignificant, doesn't it?

1022
01:15:07,938 --> 01:15:09,507
Yeah. Yeah.

1023
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:13,849
Can we have
your liver, then?

1024
01:15:14,843 --> 01:15:16,245
Yeah, all right.
You talked me into it.

1025
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:17,280
Eric!

1026
01:15:26,221 --> 01:15:29,558
Which brings us, once again,
to the urgent realization

1027
01:15:29,593 --> 01:15:32,903
of just how much there is
still left to own.

1028
01:15:33,829 --> 01:15:38,744
Item six on the agenda,
the Meaning of Life.

1029
01:15:40,869 --> 01:15:43,670
Now, Harry, you've had
some thoughts on this.

1030
01:15:43,705 --> 01:15:46,840
I've had a team working on
this over the past few weeks,

1031
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:51,448
and what we've come up with can be
reduced to two fundamental concepts.

1032
01:15:52,247 --> 01:15:54,989
One. People are not wearing enough hats.

1033
01:15:55,717 --> 01:15:58,254
Two. Matter is energy.

1034
01:15:58,687 --> 01:16:03,533
In the universe, there are many energy
fields which we cannot normally perceive.

1035
01:16:03,959 --> 01:16:08,566
Some energies have a spiritual
source, which act upon a person's soul.

1036
01:16:09,298 --> 01:16:13,001
However, this soul
does not exist ab initio,

1037
01:16:13,036 --> 01:16:15,674
as orthodox Christianity
teaches.

1038
01:16:16,104 --> 01:16:18,675
It has to be
brought into existence,

1039
01:16:18,710 --> 01:16:21,246
by a process of guided
self-observation.

1040
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:26,301
However, this is rarely achieved,
owing to man's unique ability

1041
01:16:26,336 --> 01:16:30,192
to be distracted from spiritual
matters by everyday trivia.

1042
01:16:34,356 --> 01:16:36,665
What was that about
hats again?

1043
01:16:38,026 --> 01:16:40,329
Oh, people aren't
wearing enough.

1044
01:16:40,364 --> 01:16:41,762
Is this true?

1045
01:16:41,797 --> 01:16:43,665
Certainly.
Hat sales have increased,

1046
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:45,499
but not pari passu,
as our research...

1047
01:16:45,534 --> 01:16:48,135
When you say 'enough,'
enough for what purpose?

1048
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:50,616
Can I just ask, with
reference to your second point,

1049
01:16:51,073 --> 01:16:55,248
when you say souls don't develop
because people become distracted...

1050
01:16:57,779 --> 01:17:00,191
Has anyone noticed
that building there before?

1051
01:17:02,517 --> 01:17:05,224
What?
Good Lord!

1052
01:17:25,407 --> 01:17:27,011
Good Lord!

1053
01:17:27,409 --> 01:17:30,617
<i>The Crimson
Permanent Assurance!</i>

1054
01:17:33,248 --> 01:17:36,318
<i>We interrupt this film to apologize
for this unwarranted attack</i>

1055
01:17:36,353 --> 01:17:37,728
<i>by the supporting feature.</i>

1056
01:17:37,953 --> 01:17:40,355
<i>Luckily, we have been prepared
for this eventuality</i>

1057
01:17:40,390 --> 01:17:42,300
<i>and are now taking steps
to remedy it.</i>

1058
01:17:44,393 --> 01:17:45,592
<i>Thank you.</i>

1059
01:17:45,627 --> 01:17:50,234
<i>The Meaning of Life, part six.
The autumn years.</i>

1060
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:53,066
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

1061
01:17:53,101 --> 01:17:55,581
Here's a little number I tossed
off recently in the Caribbean.

1062
01:17:56,271 --> 01:17:58,808
<i>Isn't it awfully nice
to have a penis</i>

1063
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:01,844
<i>Isn't it frightfully good
to have a dong</i>

1064
01:18:02,377 --> 01:18:05,312
<i>It's swell to have a stiffy
It's divine to own a dick</i>

1065
01:18:05,347 --> 01:18:08,623
<i>From the tiniest little tadger
to the world's biggest prick</i>

1066
01:18:09,084 --> 01:18:12,087
<i>So three cheers for your Willy
or John Thomas</i>

1067
01:18:12,654 --> 01:18:15,293
<i>Hooray for your
one-eyed trouser snake</i>

1068
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:19,366
<i>Your piece of pork, your wife's
best friend, your percy or your cock</i>

1069
01:18:19,494 --> 01:18:22,770
<i>You can wrap it up in ribbons
You can slip it in your sock</i>

1070
01:18:23,031 --> 01:18:26,168
<i>But don't take it out in public
or they will stick you in the dock</i>

1071
01:18:26,203 --> 01:18:28,074
<i>And you won't come back</i>

1072
01:18:28,109 --> 01:18:29,946
Thank you very much.

1073
01:18:32,074 --> 01:18:34,476
Oh, what a
frightfully witty song.

1074
01:18:34,511 --> 01:18:36,148
Terribly clever.

1075
01:18:39,047 --> 01:18:41,220
Jolly good.
Marvellous.

1076
01:18:48,790 --> 01:18:51,065
Oh, shit!
It's Mr. Creosote!

1077
01:19:09,911 --> 01:19:12,914
Good afternoon, sir,
and how are we today?

1078
01:19:12,949 --> 01:19:14,147
Better.
Better?

1079
01:19:14,182 --> 01:19:16,719
Better get a bucket.
I'm gonna throw up.

1080
01:19:16,885 --> 01:19:19,228
Gaston?
A bucket for monsieur.

1081
01:19:23,825 --> 01:19:25,770
<i>There we are, monsieur.</i>

1082
01:19:40,876 --> 01:19:43,178
Merci, Gaston.
I haven't finished.

1083
01:19:43,213 --> 01:19:44,679
Oh, pardon!
Gaston?

1084
01:19:44,913 --> 01:19:46,580
<i>A thousand pardons,
monsieur.</i>

1085
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:51,427
Now, this afternoon, we have
monsieur's favorite, the jugged hare.

1086
01:19:51,686 --> 01:19:56,191
The hare is very high
and the sauce is very rich,

1087
01:19:56,458 --> 01:20:01,329
with truffles, anchovies,
Grand Marnier, bacon and cream.

1088
01:20:01,364 --> 01:20:03,900
Thank you, Gaston.
There's still more.

1089
01:20:04,766 --> 01:20:06,677
Allow me.

1090
01:20:07,702 --> 01:20:09,442
<i>A new bucket
for monsieur.</i>

1091
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:14,950
And the cleaning woman.

1092
01:20:18,246 --> 01:20:21,149
<i>Et maintenant, would
monsieur care for an aperitif,</i>

1093
01:20:21,184 --> 01:20:23,652
or would he prefer
to order straightaway?

1094
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:28,733
Today, we have for
appetizers, excuse me,

1095
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:34,296
<i>moules marinières, pàtè
de foie gras, beluga caviar,</i>

1096
01:20:34,462 --> 01:20:37,998
<i>eggs Benedictine, tarte de
poireaux, that's leek tart,</i>

1097
01:20:38,033 --> 01:20:42,002
<i>frogs' legs amandine or oeufs
de caille Richard Shepherd.</i>

1098
01:20:42,037 --> 01:20:46,274
<i>C'est a dire, little quails' eggs
on a bed of purèed mushrooms.</i>

1099
01:20:46,309 --> 01:20:48,219
It's very delicate,
very succulent.

1100
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:50,216
I'll have the lot.

1101
01:20:51,179 --> 01:20:55,283
A wise choice, monsieur. And
now, how would you like it served?

1102
01:20:55,318 --> 01:20:57,786
All mixed up together
in a bucket?

1103
01:20:57,821 --> 01:20:59,753
Yeah. With the eggs on top.

1104
01:20:59,788 --> 01:21:02,057
<i>But of course.
Avec des oeufs frites.</i>

1105
01:21:02,092 --> 01:21:03,490
Don't skimp on the pãtè.

1106
01:21:03,525 --> 01:21:04,891
<i>Oh, monsieur,
I assure you,</i>

1107
01:21:04,926 --> 01:21:07,327
just because it is mixed up
with all the other things,

1108
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:09,696
we would not dream of giving
you less than the full amount.

1109
01:21:09,731 --> 01:21:13,644
In fact, I will personally make
sure you have a double helping.

1110
01:21:15,837 --> 01:21:17,304
<i>Something to drink,
monsieur?</i>

1111
01:21:17,339 --> 01:21:20,742
Yeah, I'll have six bottles
of Chateau Latour '45,

1112
01:21:20,777 --> 01:21:23,912
and a double Jeroboam of champagne. '45.

1113
01:21:23,947 --> 01:21:26,446
Bon, and the usual
brown ales?

1114
01:21:26,481 --> 01:21:30,151
Yeah. No, wait a minute. I think I
could only manage six crates today.

1115
01:21:30,186 --> 01:21:31,218
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

1116
01:21:31,253 --> 01:21:34,393
I hope monsieur was not
overdoing it last night.

1117
01:21:35,190 --> 01:21:37,190
<i>Shut up!
D'accord.</i>

1118
01:21:37,225 --> 01:21:40,501
The new bucket
and the cleaning woman.

1119
01:21:47,502 --> 01:21:49,504
Is there something wrong
with the food?

1120
01:21:49,539 --> 01:21:51,304
No, the food
was excellent.

1121
01:21:51,339 --> 01:21:53,441
Perhaps you're not happy
with the service?

1122
01:21:53,476 --> 01:21:54,875
No, no complaints.

1123
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:58,448
It's just that we have to go.
I'm having rather a heavy period.

1124
01:21:59,648 --> 01:22:01,923
And we have
a train to catch.

1125
01:22:02,784 --> 01:22:06,152
Oh! Yes, of course.
We have a train to catch

1126
01:22:06,187 --> 01:22:09,065
and I don't want to start
bleeding all over the seats.

1127
01:22:09,991 --> 01:22:12,801
Madam? Perhaps we should be going?

1128
01:22:14,262 --> 01:22:17,299
<i>Very well, monsieur.
Thank you so much.</i>

1129
01:22:17,799 --> 01:22:19,599
So nice to see you,

1130
01:22:19,634 --> 01:22:22,003
and I hope very much we
will see you again very soon.

1131
01:22:24,472 --> 01:22:27,782
Oh, dear. I have trodden
in monsieur's bucket.

1132
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:33,884
<i>Another bucket
for monsieur,</i>

1133
01:22:36,017 --> 01:22:38,429
and perhaps a hose.

1134
01:22:41,623 --> 01:22:44,160
Oh, Max. Really!

1135
01:23:00,041 --> 01:23:02,944
Finally, monsieur,
a wafer-thin mint.

1136
01:23:04,012 --> 01:23:06,992
Oh, sir, it's only a tiny,
little thin one.

1137
01:23:07,349 --> 01:23:10,022
No, fuck off. I'm full.
Oh, sir.

1138
01:23:12,721 --> 01:23:14,598
It's only wafer-thin.

1139
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:19,828
Look, I couldn't eat another
thing. I'm absolutely stuffed.

1140
01:23:19,863 --> 01:23:23,935
Bugger off.
Oh, sir, just, just one.

1141
01:23:27,068 --> 01:23:30,743
All right, just one.
Just the one, monsieur.

1142
01:23:32,507 --> 01:23:34,418
<i>Voila.</i>

1143
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:40,291
<i>Bon appetit.</i>

1144
01:24:21,790 --> 01:24:24,930
Thank you, monsieur,
and now, here's your check.

1145
01:24:39,007 --> 01:24:43,785
<i>The Meaning of Life, part 6B.
The meaning of life.</i>

1146
01:24:58,526 --> 01:25:01,761
You know, Maria,
I sometimes wonder

1147
01:25:01,796 --> 01:25:05,641
if we'll ever discover
the meaning of it all,

1148
01:25:06,034 --> 01:25:08,241
working in a place like this.

1149
01:25:08,703 --> 01:25:12,774
Well, I've worked in worse
places, philosophically speaking.

1150
01:25:12,809 --> 01:25:14,753
Really, Maria?
Yes.

1151
01:25:15,944 --> 01:25:19,114
I used to work
in the Academie Française,

1152
01:25:19,149 --> 01:25:21,581
but it didn't do me
any good at all.

1153
01:25:21,616 --> 01:25:26,565
I once worked in the library
in the Prado in Madrid,

1154
01:25:26,888 --> 01:25:29,834
but it didn't teach
me nothin', I recall,

1155
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:35,369
and the Library of Congress you'd
have thought would hold some key,

1156
01:25:35,697 --> 01:25:39,576
but it didn't, and neither
did the Bodleian Library.

1157
01:25:40,335 --> 01:25:44,374
In the British Museum,
I hoped to find some clue.

1158
01:25:44,906 --> 01:25:49,616
I worked there from 9: 00 till
6: 00, read every volume through,

1159
01:25:50,211 --> 01:25:54,318
but it didn't teach me
nothing about life's mystery.

1160
01:25:54,649 --> 01:25:58,995
I just kept getting older, and
it got more difficult to see.

1161
01:25:59,487 --> 01:26:03,799
Till eventually, me eyes
went and me arthritis got bad.

1162
01:26:04,392 --> 01:26:07,202
So now,
I'm cleaning up in here.

1163
01:26:08,596 --> 01:26:11,131
But I can't
be really sad,

1164
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:14,936
'cause you see,
I feel that life's a game.

1165
01:26:14,971 --> 01:26:18,071
You sometimes win or lose,

1166
01:26:18,106 --> 01:26:20,643
and though I may
be down right now,

1167
01:26:21,009 --> 01:26:23,648
at least I don't
work for Jews.

1168
01:26:28,449 --> 01:26:30,394
I'm so sorry.

1169
01:26:30,585 --> 01:26:34,039
I had no idea we had
a racist working here.

1170
01:26:34,074 --> 01:26:37,493
I apologize most sincerely.

1171
01:26:37,725 --> 01:26:39,101
I mean...

1172
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:42,335
Where are you going?
No, I can explain...

1173
01:26:47,902 --> 01:26:49,540
As for me...

1174
01:26:50,138 --> 01:26:53,813
If you want to know what I
think, I'll show you something.

1175
01:26:56,077 --> 01:26:59,251
Come with me.
I was saying that...

1176
01:27:00,481 --> 01:27:01,823
Hello?
Come on.

1177
01:27:03,351 --> 01:27:04,522
Hello?

1178
01:27:06,554 --> 01:27:08,931
Hello!
This way.

1179
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:16,106
Come on.
Don't be shy.

1180
01:27:17,098 --> 01:27:19,077
Mind the stairs,
all right?

1181
01:27:23,605 --> 01:27:25,778
I think this
will help explain.

1182
01:27:33,314 --> 01:27:35,225
Come along.
Come along.

1183
01:27:38,353 --> 01:27:40,264
Over here.

1184
01:27:50,798 --> 01:27:52,368
Come on.
Come on.

1185
01:27:57,338 --> 01:27:58,612
This way.

1186
01:28:02,543 --> 01:28:03,783
Come on.

1187
01:28:07,782 --> 01:28:09,056
This way.

1188
01:28:11,219 --> 01:28:12,698
Stay by me.

1189
01:28:15,990 --> 01:28:17,628
Nearly there now.

1190
01:28:27,602 --> 01:28:29,081
You see that?

1191
01:28:31,739 --> 01:28:33,718
That's where I was born.

1192
01:28:35,743 --> 01:28:39,779
You know, one day, my mother,

1193
01:28:39,814 --> 01:28:42,385
she put me on her knee
and she said to me,

1194
01:28:43,718 --> 01:28:45,985
'Gaston, my son,

1195
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:49,023
'the world
is a beautiful place.

1196
01:28:50,391 --> 01:28:53,736
'You must go into it
and love everyone. '

1197
01:28:55,730 --> 01:29:01,336
'Try to make everyone happy
and bring peace and contentment,

1198
01:29:01,371 --> 01:29:03,042
'everywhere you go. '

1199
01:29:04,906 --> 01:29:06,851
So I became a waiter.

1200
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:19,390
Well, it's not much
of a philosophy, I know.

1201
01:29:21,322 --> 01:29:24,200
Well, fuck you.

1202
01:29:24,392 --> 01:29:26,997
I can live my own life
in my own way if I want to.

1203
01:29:28,563 --> 01:29:29,666
Fuck off.

1204
01:29:31,999 --> 01:29:33,842
Don't come following me.

1205
01:29:41,542 --> 01:29:45,615
<i>The Meaning of Life,
part seven. Death.</i>

1206
01:30:10,938 --> 01:30:13,145
<i>This man is about to die.</i>

1207
01:30:13,307 --> 01:30:16,242
<i>In a few moments now,
he will be killed,</i>

1208
01:30:16,277 --> 01:30:18,945
<i>for Arthur Jarrett
is a convicted criminal,</i>

1209
01:30:18,980 --> 01:30:22,893
<i>who has been allowed to choose
the manner of his own execution.</i>

1210
01:30:26,888 --> 01:30:28,833
There he is.

1211
01:30:43,137 --> 01:30:47,744
Arthur Charles Herbert
Runcie MacAdam Jarrett,

1212
01:30:48,810 --> 01:30:52,416
you have been convicted by
12 good persons, and true,

1213
01:30:52,713 --> 01:30:57,559
of the crime of first degree
making of gratuitous sexist jokes,

1214
01:30:57,819 --> 01:30:59,662
in a moving picture.

1215
01:31:37,058 --> 01:31:40,232
Ashes to ashes,
dust to dust.

1216
01:31:44,298 --> 01:31:45,865
It's no good.

1217
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:49,540
I just can't go on.
I'm no good anymore.

1218
01:31:50,738 --> 01:31:53,150
I want to end it all!

1219
01:31:53,908 --> 01:31:56,310
Goodbye! Goodbye!

1220
01:32:03,718 --> 01:32:06,255
Oh, my God!

1221
01:32:07,054 --> 01:32:09,090
Oh, no! I...

1222
01:32:09,824 --> 01:32:14,136
What'll I do? I can't
live without him! I...

1223
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:21,304
Mummy!
Mum, where are you?

1224
01:32:21,469 --> 01:32:24,270
Daddy? Mummy?

1225
01:32:24,305 --> 01:32:26,250
Mummy?

1226
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:33,675
Yes?

1227
01:33:35,676 --> 01:33:37,211
Is it about the hedge?

1228
01:33:40,081 --> 01:33:44,051
Well, I'm awfully sorry,
but... I am the Grim Reaper.

1229
01:33:44,086 --> 01:33:47,109
Who?
The Grim Reaper.

1230
01:33:47,144 --> 01:33:50,133
Yes, I see.
I am Death.

1231
01:33:51,325 --> 01:33:52,358
Yes, well, the thing is,

1232
01:33:52,393 --> 01:33:54,712
we've got some people from
America for dinner tonight...

1233
01:33:54,747 --> 01:33:56,996
Who is it, darling?
It's a Mr. Death or something.

1234
01:33:57,031 --> 01:34:00,518
He's come about the reaping? I don't
think we need any at the moment.

1235
01:34:00,553 --> 01:34:04,005
Hello. Don't leave him hanging
around outside, darling. Ask him in.

1236
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:05,339
I don't think
it's quite the moment.

1237
01:34:05,374 --> 01:34:06,572
Do come in.
Come along.

1238
01:34:06,607 --> 01:34:09,019
Come and have a drink.
Do. Come on.

1239
01:34:12,747 --> 01:34:15,352
It's one of the little men
from the village.

1240
01:34:15,683 --> 01:34:17,719
Do come in.
Please.

1241
01:34:18,686 --> 01:34:21,489
This is Howard Katzenberg
from Philadelphia.

1242
01:34:21,524 --> 01:34:23,557
H i.
And his wife, Debbie.

1243
01:34:23,592 --> 01:34:24,865
Hello, there.

1244
01:34:25,159 --> 01:34:28,401
And these are the Portland
Smythes, Jeremy and Fiona.

1245
01:34:28,529 --> 01:34:31,407
Good evening.
This is Mr. Death.

1246
01:34:38,706 --> 01:34:41,550
Do get Mr. Death a drink, darling. Yes.

1247
01:34:42,543 --> 01:34:44,750
Mr. Death is a reaper.

1248
01:34:44,945 --> 01:34:48,119
The Grim Reaper.

1249
01:34:48,449 --> 01:34:50,758
Hardly surprising
in this weather.

1250
01:34:53,287 --> 01:34:55,923
So you still reap around
here, do you, Mr. Death?

1251
01:34:55,958 --> 01:35:00,496
I am the Grim Reaper.

1252
01:35:01,228 --> 01:35:02,832
That's about all he says.

1253
01:35:02,997 --> 01:35:05,477
There's your drink, Mr. Death.
Do sit down.

1254
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:08,969
We were just talking about some of
the awful problems facing the Third...

1255
01:35:13,674 --> 01:35:17,778
Would you prefer white? I'm
afraid we don't have any beer.

1256
01:35:17,813 --> 01:35:19,279
The Stilton's
awfully good.

1257
01:35:20,181 --> 01:35:26,131
I am not of this world.

1258
01:35:28,556 --> 01:35:30,091
Good Lord.

1259
01:35:30,291 --> 01:35:33,169
I am Death.

1260
01:35:37,598 --> 01:35:38,764
Well, isn't that
extraordinary?

1261
01:35:38,799 --> 01:35:41,969
We were just talking about
death only five minutes ago.

1262
01:35:42,004 --> 01:35:45,139
Yes, we were. You know, whether
death is really the end...

1263
01:35:45,174 --> 01:35:48,460
As my husband Howard here
feels, or whether there is,

1264
01:35:48,495 --> 01:35:51,746
and one so hates to use words
like soul or spirit...

1265
01:35:51,781 --> 01:35:53,748
What other words can one use? Exactly.

1266
01:35:53,783 --> 01:35:57,354
You do not understand.

1267
01:35:58,919 --> 01:36:01,262
No. Obviously not.

1268
01:36:01,489 --> 01:36:04,623
I'll tell you something,
Mr. Death... You don't...

1269
01:36:04,658 --> 01:36:07,094
Just one moment. I'd like to
express on behalf of everybody here,

1270
01:36:07,129 --> 01:36:09,180
what a really unique
experience this is.

1271
01:36:09,215 --> 01:36:11,024
Hear, hear.
Yes, we're so delighted

1272
01:36:11,059 --> 01:36:12,798
that you dropped in,
Mr. Death.

1273
01:36:12,833 --> 01:36:15,506
Can I just finish, please?
Mr. Death.

1274
01:36:16,370 --> 01:36:18,406
Is there an afterlife?

1275
01:36:19,106 --> 01:36:20,840
Dear, if you could
just wait, please...

1276
01:36:20,875 --> 01:36:22,676
Are you sure you wouldn't
like some sherry or...

1277
01:36:22,711 --> 01:36:24,812
Angela, I'd like
to say this, please.

1278
01:36:24,847 --> 01:36:25,978
Be quiet!

1279
01:36:26,013 --> 01:36:27,548
Can I just say this
at this time, please?

1280
01:36:27,583 --> 01:36:32,019
Silence!
I have come for you.

1281
01:36:34,388 --> 01:36:36,876
You mean to...

1282
01:36:36,911 --> 01:36:39,365
Take you away.

1283
01:36:40,594 --> 01:36:43,631
That is my purpose.

1284
01:36:45,499 --> 01:36:48,707
I am Death.

1285
01:36:51,238 --> 01:36:54,082
Well, that's cast rather a gloom
over the evening, hasn't it?

1286
01:36:54,375 --> 01:36:55,717
I don't see it
that way, Geoff.

1287
01:36:55,910 --> 01:36:58,295
Let me tell you what I think
we're dealing with here,

1288
01:36:58,330 --> 01:37:00,681
a potentially positive
learning experience that can...

1289
01:37:00,716 --> 01:37:03,701
Shut up!
Shut up, you American.

1290
01:37:03,736 --> 01:37:06,687
You always talk,
you Americans.

1291
01:37:06,854 --> 01:37:09,955
You talk and you talk
and you say,

1292
01:37:09,990 --> 01:37:14,995
'Let me tell you something'
and 'I just wanna say this. '

1293
01:37:15,030 --> 01:37:18,670
Well, you're dead now,
so shut up!

1294
01:37:18,866 --> 01:37:21,403
Dead?
Dead.

1295
01:37:23,470 --> 01:37:26,746
All of us?
All of you.

1296
01:37:29,009 --> 01:37:30,142
Now look here.

1297
01:37:30,177 --> 01:37:32,845
You barge in here quite
uninvited, break glasses,

1298
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:35,381
and then announce quite
casually that we're all dead.

1299
01:37:35,416 --> 01:37:39,053
Well, I would remind you that
you're a guest in this house...

1300
01:37:39,088 --> 01:37:44,434
Be quiet! Englishmen!
You're all so fucking pompous!

1301
01:37:44,892 --> 01:37:47,804
None of you
have got any balls.

1302
01:37:48,896 --> 01:37:51,672
Can I ask you a question?
What?

1303
01:37:52,433 --> 01:37:55,345
How can we all have died
at the same time?

1304
01:38:08,115 --> 01:38:10,561
The salmon mousse.

1305
01:38:11,852 --> 01:38:14,889
Darling, you didn't use
canned salmon, did you?

1306
01:38:15,155 --> 01:38:18,329
I'm most dreadfully
embarrassed.

1307
01:38:18,926 --> 01:38:22,339
Now the time has come.

1308
01:38:23,764 --> 01:38:28,269
Follow. Follow me.

1309
01:38:42,549 --> 01:38:45,222
Just testing. Sorry.

1310
01:38:46,887 --> 01:38:50,266
Follow me. Now.

1311
01:38:57,064 --> 01:38:58,372
Come.

1312
01:39:02,136 --> 01:39:05,005
The fishmonger promised me
he'd have some fresh salmon.

1313
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:07,206
He's normally so reliable.

1314
01:39:07,241 --> 01:39:10,017
Can we take our glasses?
Good idea.

1315
01:39:13,580 --> 01:39:16,151
Hey, I didn't even
eat the mousse.

1316
01:39:21,522 --> 01:39:24,056
Honestly, darling,
I'm so embarrassed.

1317
01:39:24,091 --> 01:39:27,661
It really is embarrassing. I
mean, to serve salmon with botulism

1318
01:39:27,696 --> 01:39:29,606
at a dinner party
is social death.

1319
01:39:32,032 --> 01:39:34,768
Shall we take our cars?
Why not?

1320
01:39:34,803 --> 01:39:37,612
Good idea.
Why not?

1321
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:16,544
Behold Paradise.

1322
01:40:18,679 --> 01:40:22,558
I love it here, darling.
Me, too, Marvin.

1323
01:40:22,950 --> 01:40:25,487
Hello. Welcome to heaven.

1324
01:40:35,029 --> 01:40:37,270
Excuse me. Could you just
sign here, please, sir?

1325
01:40:38,665 --> 01:40:39,698
Thank you.

1326
01:40:39,733 --> 01:40:41,802
There's a table for you through
there, in the restaurant.

1327
01:40:41,837 --> 01:40:42,868
Thank you.

1328
01:40:42,903 --> 01:40:46,473
For the ladies.
Afterlife mints.

1329
01:40:46,508 --> 01:40:48,282
Thank you.
Happy Christmas.

1330
01:40:48,509 --> 01:40:50,044
Oh, is it Christmas today?

1331
01:40:50,079 --> 01:40:51,410
Of course, madam.

1332
01:40:51,445 --> 01:40:53,480
It's Christmas every day
in heaven.

1333
01:40:53,515 --> 01:40:56,256
Oh! How 'bout that?
Lovely.

1334
01:41:41,462 --> 01:41:43,429
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

1335
01:41:43,464 --> 01:41:47,968
It's truly a real honourable
experience to be here this evening,

1336
01:41:48,003 --> 01:41:50,602
a very wonderful and warm

1337
01:41:50,637 --> 01:41:53,049
and emotional moment
for all of us.

1338
01:41:53,740 --> 01:41:55,876
And I'd like to
sing a song,

1339
01:41:55,911 --> 01:41:58,788
for all of you.

1340
01:42:03,150 --> 01:42:09,692
<i>It's Christmas in heaven
All the children sing</i>

1341
01:42:10,591 --> 01:42:13,469
<i>It's Christmas in heaven</i>

1342
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:17,865
<i>Hark, hark,
those church bells ring</i>

1343
01:42:17,900 --> 01:42:21,039
<i>It's Christmas in heaven</i>

1344
01:42:21,301 --> 01:42:24,837
<i>The snow falls from the sky</i>

1345
01:42:24,872 --> 01:42:28,442
<i>But it's nice and warm
and everyone</i>

1346
01:42:28,477 --> 01:42:31,787
<i>Looks smart and wears a tie</i>

1347
01:42:37,718 --> 01:42:41,005
<i>It's Christmas in heaven</i>

1348
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:44,292
<i>There's great films on TV</i>

1349
01:42:44,858 --> 01:42:48,495
<i>The Sound of Music
twice an hour</i>

1350
01:42:48,530 --> 01:42:51,771
And Jaws I, II and III

1351
01:42:52,232 --> 01:42:55,936
<i>There's gifts
for all the family</i>

1352
01:42:55,971 --> 01:42:59,605
<i>There's toiletries
and trains</i>

1353
01:42:59,640 --> 01:43:03,277
<i>There's Sony Walkman
headphone sets</i>

1354
01:43:03,312 --> 01:43:06,485
<i>And the latest video games</i>

1355
01:43:06,813 --> 01:43:09,793
<i>It's Christmas
It's Christmas in heaven</i>

1356
01:43:11,185 --> 01:43:13,562
<i>Hip, hip, hip, hip
hip hooray</i>

1357
01:43:13,754 --> 01:43:16,700
<i>Every single day</i>

1358
01:43:17,224 --> 01:43:19,727
<i>Is Christmas Day</i>

1359
01:43:21,495 --> 01:43:24,271
<i>It's Christmas
It's Christmas in heaven</i>

1360
01:43:25,666 --> 01:43:28,335
<i>Hip, hip, hip, hip
hip hooray</i>

1361
01:43:28,370 --> 01:43:33,181
<i>Every single day is...</i>

1362
01:43:35,976 --> 01:43:37,231
Well, that's the end
of the film.

1363
01:43:37,266 --> 01:43:38,486
Now here's
the meaning of life.

1364
01:43:40,914 --> 01:43:42,085
Thank you, Brigitte.

1365
01:43:47,387 --> 01:43:48,661
Well, it's nothing
very special.

1366
01:43:48,855 --> 01:43:50,756
'Try and be nice to people.
Avoid eating fat.

1367
01:43:50,791 --> 01:43:53,227
'Read a good book every now
and then. Get some walking in,

1368
01:43:53,262 --> 01:43:54,928
'and try and live together
in peace and harmony

1369
01:43:54,963 --> 01:43:56,634
'with people of all creeds
and nations. '

1370
01:43:57,264 --> 01:44:00,200
And finally, here are some completely
gratuitous pictures of penises,

1371
01:44:00,235 --> 01:44:03,487
to annoy the censors and to hopefully
spark some sort of controversy,

1372
01:44:03,522 --> 01:44:06,740
which is the only way these days
to get the jaded video-sated public

1373
01:44:06,775 --> 01:44:09,532
off their fucking arses and
back in the sodding cinema.

1374
01:44:09,567 --> 01:44:12,289
Family entertainment? Bollocks.
What they want is filth.

1375
01:44:12,512 --> 01:44:13,679
People doing things
to each other

1376
01:44:13,714 --> 01:44:15,647
with chainsaws
during Tupperware parties,

1377
01:44:15,682 --> 01:44:19,152
baby-sitters being stabbed with knitting
needles by gay presidential candidates,

1378
01:44:19,187 --> 01:44:21,119
vigilante groups
strangling chickens,

1379
01:44:21,154 --> 01:44:23,924
armed bands of theater critics
exterminating mutant goats.

1380
01:44:23,959 --> 01:44:27,060
Where's the fun in pictures?
Oh, well, there we are.

1381
01:44:27,095 --> 01:44:29,369
Here's the theme music.
Good night.

1382
01:44:42,709 --> 01:44:47,246
<i>Just remember that
you're standing on a planet</i>

1383
01:44:47,281 --> 01:44:51,456
<i>That's evolving and revolving
at 900 miles an hour</i>

1384
01:44:52,552 --> 01:44:56,590
<i>It's orbiting at 19 miles
a second, so it's reckoned</i>

1385
01:44:56,625 --> 01:44:59,661
<i>A sun that is the source
of all our power</i>

1386
01:45:00,527 --> 01:45:04,304
<i>The sun and you and me and
all the stars that we can see</i>

1387
01:45:04,431 --> 01:45:07,639
<i>Are moving
at a million miles a day</i>

1388
01:45:08,435 --> 01:45:12,472
<i>In an outer spiral arm
at 40,000 miles an hour</i>

1389
01:45:12,507 --> 01:45:15,316
<i>Of the galaxy
we call the Milky Way</i>

1390
01:45:24,384 --> 01:45:27,990
<i>Our galaxy itself contains
a hundred billion stars</i>

1391
01:45:28,025 --> 01:45:31,596
<i>It's a hundred thousand
light years side to side</i>

1392
01:45:32,392 --> 01:45:35,914
<i>It bulges in the middle
16,000 light years thick</i>

1393
01:45:35,949 --> 01:45:39,436
<i>But out by us, it's just
3,000 light years wide</i>

1394
01:45:40,300 --> 01:45:43,970
<i>We're 30,000 light years
from galactic central point</i>

1395
01:45:44,005 --> 01:45:46,973
<i>We go round every
200 million years</i>

1396
01:45:48,075 --> 01:45:51,745
<i>And our galaxy is only
one of millions of billions</i>

1397
01:45:51,780 --> 01:45:54,953
<i>In this amazing
and expanding universe</i>

1398
01:46:27,447 --> 01:46:31,952
<i>The universe itself keeps on
expanding and expanding</i>

1399
01:46:31,987 --> 01:46:35,058
<i>In all of the directions
it can whizz</i>

1400
01:46:35,956 --> 01:46:39,858
<i>As fast as it can go at
the speed of light, you know</i>

1401
01:46:39,893 --> 01:46:43,497
<i>Twelve million miles a minute and
that's the fastest speed there is</i>

1402
01:46:43,532 --> 01:46:47,734
<i>So remember when you're
feeling very small and insecure</i>

1403
01:46:47,769 --> 01:46:50,908
<i>How amazingly unlikely
is your birth</i>

1404
01:46:52,005 --> 01:46:55,342
<i>And pray that there's intelligent
life somewhere up in space</i>

1405
01:46:55,377 --> 01:46:58,220
<i>'Cause there's bugger all
down here on Earth</i>
